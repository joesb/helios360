The newsletter focusses on project delivery and team leadership. Sometimes it’ll be about broader issues that delivery principals should be aware of and have a good working understanding about — things about economics, technology, geopolitics, and culture, for instance, all things that shape what we’re doing as delivery principals and why we’re doing it.

It features insights and vital perspectives on delivery leadership — principles and practices without the usual management speak or corporate junk talk.

A regular dose of inspiration. A fresh perspective on service delivery leadership.

Subscribe, and you’ll get thought-provoking items and motivating posts directly in your inbox.
