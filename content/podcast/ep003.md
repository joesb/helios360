  Communication is a key skill in all jobs, right?

  Well, clear and coherent communication is of a different order for a Chief Delivery Officer — unusual excellence in communication is a fundamental requirement of the job and an essential skill that should be particularly well developed.{.smaller}

  The CDO is responsible for effective communication between all parties on projects: clear communication is vital to achieve outcomes.{.small}
  
  The CDO determines what and how a business communicates with customers and stakeholders. And so the CDO should show distinctive leadership in this key area.{.small}

In this episode we discuss the astonishing breadth of modes and contexts for communication for a CDO, verbal and non-verbal, in meetings and events and ad hoc, in big groups and small groups as much as one-to-one, both in person and asynchronous, and all manner of other ways.

We talk also about how a deep and practical understanding of multiple intelligences and personality types can be a giant power-up for transformative and effective communication.

In the second half of the episode, we look more practically at communicating with customers and with colleagues, and how a CDO should be conscious of how the mode and manner of communication needs to adapt according to context and needs.
