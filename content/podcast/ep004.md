In the first half, we talk about the three Cs that are the aim of professionalism, and what it brings to clients and the business:

- Calmness
- Confidence
- Consistency

We discuss the essence of professionalism:

- Capturing 'our ways of working'
- Making sure there's always value delivered — for customers, and for the standing of the business
- Ensuring efficiency — removing unnecessary overheads
- Giving clarity
- And making the best client experience possible

And we talk about how hyper-growth can jeopardise a lot of that!

In the second half of the episode we talk about the 'why' of processes — why they're there:

- they're the way you do things, adding to the distinctive character of the business
- they're reliable, replicable practices — and that can lead to automations
- they're clear, and can be explained easily to customers

But processes should also be separate from the person themself, like a product for the business.

Lastly we talk about the hazard of processes that over-boil!
