The very first episode of the Deliver That! podcast. It's a show about delivery leadership for projects, teams, and programs — the big concepts, real-life stories from the front line, and everything involved in the role of a Chief Delivery Officer.

In episode 1 we introduce the podcast and ourselves:

- What’s the reason for the podcast and what are we aiming to do with it?
- Who are we, Steve Hunton and Joe Baker?
- And what's the plan?

And then the heart of the discussion in this episode — what actually is a CDO, and why are we going to be talking about a Chief Delivery Officer here, rather than, say, a delivery principal or head of PMO or whatever?

We're advocating for the role being seen as an executive level, CxO role for good reasons, which we talk about in this episode … but is really the point of the show as a whole and the nitty gritty of all this is what'll be talked about in all the episodes ahead.

We also give a thumbnail sketch of what a CDO does, the primary focus and orientation in the role. But it's only broad brushstrokes really, coz this is what the show is about.
