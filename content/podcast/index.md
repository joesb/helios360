For over two decades we’ve delivered more digital transformation projects than we care to count … and not all of them went to plan.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

We discuss it all — what works in delivery leadership and what doesn’t, and what’s important in the ideas behind the buzzwords.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

And we’ll share our experiences of what it actually takes to deliver successful outcomes.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

Plus we’ll have some fascinating guests to hear their own stories, the lessons they learned and the scars they earned.

**Deliver That!** — the Chief Delivery Officer’s podcast

No filters. No fluff.

Just honest conversations about what happens in project delivery, and how big things really get done.
