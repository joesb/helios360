We’re off for a while. But we’ll be back soon, ready to go.

Thanks for listening along to everything we’ve talked about so far. We really appreciate your company.

While we’re away, do listen back to anything you’ve missed. And send us a message, if you’d like, with your thoughts or questions on the things we’ve covered and the things we haven’t — you can use the contact form on the [podcast homepage](/podcast/).

So, we’ll see you when we’re back in a few weeks.

Until then, ciao. Have a good one.
