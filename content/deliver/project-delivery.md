### 1. Focus on user needs{.text-color-brand-secondary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none }

### 4. Fail fast and learn quickly{.text-color-brand-secondary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none}

### 5. Keep planning{.text-color-brand-secondary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none}
