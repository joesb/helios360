A fractional Chief Delivery Officer (CDO) is a senior executive who works closely with a CEO or founder to [align the client delivery strategy and execution](/handbook/why/you-need-a-cdo/) with both the business goals and their customers' needs. A fractional leader works with a company on a part-time or per-project basis, providing strategic service delivery leadership and expertise to oversee the successful execution of key initiatives or specific objectives without the commitment of a full-time position.

A fractional CDO gives part of their professional attention, effort and expertise to a business. But it’s not only about time — the [key metrics](/handbook/why/measuring-impact/) for a fractional CDO’s contribution are primarily focused on [value, impact, or results](/handbook/why/set-up-for-success/).

A fractional Chief Delivery Officer offers particular impact because they bring extensive real-world experience, maturity, and expertise. The fractional CDO is both a subject matter expert, designing the delivery strategy that is right for the business, and works to implement and embed the customer delivery practices in executing the CDO role for the business.

More than overseeing delivery, though, the fractional Chief Delivery Officer models how to optimise a customer's experience of the business. Service delivery is often the part of the company that clients experience most closely and, done well, is a foundation stone for an organisation's reputation.
