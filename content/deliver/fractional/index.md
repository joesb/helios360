As a founder–owner or CEO you'll be familiar with the start-up phase and the *all hands on deck* energy it needs.

But things change as your business grows, and each phase of growth makes new demands on you:

- when you *step up*{.larger .text-color-brand-secondary} to be the leader of your business
*(10–30 people, roughly)*
- when the business has to *smarten up*{.larger .text-color-brand-secondary}, and you become the leader of the leadership team
*(30–75 people)*
- when you're *scaling up*{.larger .text-color-brand-secondary} the business into maturity, where it can stand on its own
*(75+ people)*

There's constant challenges that are constantly changing as the business changes constantly. You may well feel like you're struggling to keep your head above water, that there's always fires you're fighting, that you get worryingly close to burning out.

Or you may find that the way you used to run the business doesn't work now that you've grown, those old rules of thumb don't fit any more.

Most significantly, you may find that customer work becomes problematic as it gets bigger, becomes harder to deliver on time without demanding all your focus or burning out your team, even begins to feel stressful, chaotic and out of control.

Bringing in a fractional Chief Delivery Officer (CDO) will help you overcome scaling challenges without the cost and commitment of a full-time hire.

The right fractional CDO will give you the combination of strategic insight and deep hands-on customer delivery expertise that you need as you scale your business.
