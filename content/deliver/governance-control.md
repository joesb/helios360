Effective delivery depends on the project governance that is appropriate, with a clear view of what's planned, what's been achieved, and what's next. This view is built on meaningful metrics, efficient risk management, and clear communication to enable thoughtful project controls and effective decision making.

## Who is involved in governance

Delivery teams need help from people who are responsible for supporting their work through management and governance activity, with guidance and timely decisions on progress and priorities.

- the service owner(s)
- delivery managers
- senior responsible stakeholders
- chief technology officers

Others may have a view, though likely less involved from day to day:

- other executive team
- other senior leaders
- auditors and assurers

## The principles

These core principles are essential in every environment

### 1. Don’t slow down delivery{.text-color-brand-secondary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none }

Short-but-frequent meetings to maintain visibility without impediments, a clear view on risks and strategies to address them, whilst protecting the team from undue pressures.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

### 2. Decisions when they’re needed, at the right level{.text-color-brand-secondary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none }

Embrace the truth that things change and decisions need to be made frequently with evidence-based decision making, made by those with the authority to decide, who understand the boundaries, and who are accountable.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

#### Risk management{.padding-inline-start-vlg .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none}

Risks can't be eliminated, but you can own and handle those that affect service delivery. Deal with risks at the right time, with clear plans for the response.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

### 3. Do it with the right people{.text-color-brand-secondary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none}

Project governance is only possible with people who are: capable, motivated and empowered; focused on goals and outcomes; open and honest about what they do.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

### 4. Go see for yourself{.text-color-brand-secondary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none }

Key stakeholders must be fully informed so they can make decisions quickly, including visiting teams regularly and taking part in a events, particularly sprint reviews or demonstrations.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

#### Reporting and planning{.padding-inline-start-vlg .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none}

Being with the team, seeing the work, reviewing the data and what it says (as KPIs) all give what's needed for effective governance and the support needed for consistent delivery.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

### 5. Only do it if it adds value{.text-color-brand-secondary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none }

Clear outcomes and success measures ensure the service can deliver continuously on the things that add value for user needs and organisational goals.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

### 6. Trust and verify{.text-color-brand-secondary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none }

Good governance is simple and supportive. It trusts individuals and gives decision-making authority to teams so they can focus on delivering. Regular reflection on how teams are doing and finding ways to improve is an important part of good governance.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}
