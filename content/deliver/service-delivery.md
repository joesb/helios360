## The principles

Although project and service delivery necessarily will vary from one context to another, these core principles are essential in every environment:

### 1. Focus on user needs{.text-color-brand-tertiary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none }

  Services are only effective where they respond to true users' needs, solving real problems.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

### 2. Deliver iteratively{.text-color-brand-tertiary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none}

  Deliver value to users fast, take feedback, make improvements. Repeat.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

### 3. Keep improving how the team works{.text-color-brand-tertiary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none}

  Keep talking with the team to hear what's working and identify what's not. Agree ways to fix things, and do it.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

### 4. Fail fast and learn quickly{.text-color-brand-tertiary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none}

  Prevent major failures by making small failures first _and learning from them_. Demonstrate value to senior stakeholders by releasing regularly, with evaluation on key metrics.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

### 5. Keep planning{.text-color-brand-tertiary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none}

  Use data and usage patterns to review the work and continually make plans with the delivery team for the next steps, based on progress and new insights.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

## The process

### 1. Consultation{.text-color-brand-tertiary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none }

  Objectives, capabilities, and resources:
  Understand the business. Understand the team. Understand the client. Understand the users. Understand the project.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

### 2. Design{.text-color-brand-tertiary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none }

  Drawing on extensive experience, design a bespoke strategy for effective client service delivery.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

### 3. Planning{.text-color-brand-tertiary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none }

  Develop a thoroughgoing plan, with a view across the project from inception through delivery to live service and eventual sunset. Detail for what's now, alignment on what's next, and perspective on what's later.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

### 4. Execution{.text-color-brand-tertiary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none }

  Do it. Enabling skilled people to do things with great skill as one team, with full ongoing support, and continual review and re-planning.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}

### 5. Evaluation{.text-color-brand-tertiary .margin-block-start-md .margin-block-end-none }

  It's never fully over, you're always learning. Use data and metrics to evaluate what's worked and what hasn't and be even better next time.{.padding-inline-start-vlg .paragraph-narrow}
