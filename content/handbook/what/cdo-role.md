The Chief Delivery Officer has a distinctive role amongst other C-suite colleagues, and it's important that we spend some time here looking at the role in the round before progressing into specific areas in the rest of the *Handbook*.

There's similarities, of course — the CDO is a domain specialist, like a Chief Financial Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, or Chief Technology Officer, say. The CDO also affects elements across the whole business, like a Chief Operating Officer or Chief Data Officer.

But the role of a Chief Delivery Officer stands out for some important and distinctive reasons.

Here we'll explored what those are, why they're important — both for the CDO and for the business — and how they frame the position and function of the CDO in the organisation.

## So, what actually is a Chief Delivery Officer?

We've already set out a definition of the Chief Delivery Officer previously, at the [beginning of this *Handbook*](/handbook/), but it may be useful to reiterate some of that here.

> The Chief Delivery Officer (CDO) is a key leadership role.
>
> Normally an executive-level role, the CDO works closely with other leaders in the organisation to align the client delivery strategy with both the business goals and customers' needs.

Let's divide this into two parts.

### The Chief Delivery Officer among equals

The first dimension involves acknowledging that a Chief Delivery Officer is an executive-level role, a peer amongst other C-suite colleagues with a view across and an impact that affects the whole organisation.

A CDO needs to be able to work closely with other leaders in the organisation.

The CDO cannot solve all the problems the business faces, obviously, but that is the remit of the executive team together — to combine the experience and wisdom accumulated in their distinct specialisms to work together to achieve the goals and objectives of the business, and together to overcome the difficulties and challenges presented to the organisation.

The process of delivering products and/or services for the company is a unique component of that effort, which means that the person responsible for that duty also has a distinctive and vital contribution to role to play at that executive level.

### Delivery aligned with business goals
