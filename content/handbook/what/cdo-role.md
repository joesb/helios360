The Chief Delivery Officer has a distinctive role amongst other C-suite colleagues, and it's important that we spend some time here looking at the role in the round before progressing into specific areas in the rest of the *Handbook*.

There's similarities, of course — the CDO is a domain specialist, like a Chief Financial Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, or Chief Technology Officer, say. The CDO also affects elements across the whole business, like a Chief Operating Officer or Chief Data Officer.

But the role of a Chief Delivery Officer stands out for some important and distinctive reasons.

Here we'll explored what those are, why they're important — both for the CDO and for the business — and how they frame the position and function of the CDO in the organisation.

The role of Chief Delivery Officer is a relatively new label for a set of duties and responsibilities in the organisation. Previously these functions might have been handled by someone at a different level in the business who reports, directly or maybe indirectly, to someone at executive level — maybe the Chief Operating Officer, say. Here we are going to examine the case for viewing this role as an executive-level role in itself.

## So, what actually is a Chief Delivery Officer?

We've already set out a definition of the Chief Delivery Officer previously, at the [beginning of this *Handbook*](/handbook/), but it may be useful to reiterate some of that here.

> The Chief Delivery Officer (CDO) is a key leadership role.
>
> Normally an executive-level role, the CDO works closely with other leaders in the organisation to align the client delivery strategy with both the business goals and customers' needs.

Let's divide this opening section into two parts.

### The Chief Delivery Officer among equals

The first dimension involves acknowledging that a Chief Delivery Officer is an executive-level role, a peer amongst other C-suite colleagues with a view across and an impact that touches the whole organisation.

A CDO needs to be able to work closely with other leaders in the organisation.

The CDO cannot solve all the problems the business faces, obviously, but that is the precisely remit of the executive team together — to combine the experience and wisdom accumulated in their distinct specialisms to work together to achieve the goals and objectives of the business, and together to overcome the difficulties and challenges presented to the organisation.

The process of delivering products and/or services for the company is a unique component of that effort. Service delivery is a part of the business that clients experience most closely. In some contexts, it's the essential component.

- **If you're a service business:**
  - service delivery is the cornerstone of your offering
- **If you're a product business:**
  - all of your customers will experience a form delivery when they buy your product, taking them from the point of purchase to successful users
  - and it's also likely that your biggest and best customers will want some form of professional services wrap-around to your product

In other words, the company's reputation is built on how you deliver for customers.

Service delivery does not sit in sweet isolation, of course. It's a core part of the whole customer journey, but that starts way before services are being delivered in the marketing phase and sales experience. And it continues on afterwards, too, into the live service stage where clients should be successful in using what they've bought, and look to buy more from the business, all being well.

Coherence throughout that customer journey is vital.

- The CDO's delivery strategy and its execution will, in part, determine what that customer journey looks like and how it functions.
- The CDO's delivery strategy and its execution will make demands on the marketing and sales process, so that the 'right' customers in the 'right' state are purchasing products and services from the business.
- The CDO's delivery strategy and its execution will define how successfully your customers use your products and services, and whether they come back as continued clients or even but more from you.

In summary, then, the Chief Delivery Officer is the person responsible for how you deliver your services and products. That gives them a distinctive and vital contribution to role to play at the executive level.

### Delivery aligned with business goals
