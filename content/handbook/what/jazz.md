As the business matures, it stretches forward towards greater professionalism. Professionalism covers many things, but a large part of that is comprehensive, robust, replicable processes that are clear for customers and staff, reflect the organisation’s persona, and are in tight alignment with business objectives. That is true for client delivery just as it is for any other part of the business.

Importantly, the delivery principal should build themselves out of the systems and processes they design. If a customer or project needs to switch delivery personnel for whatever reason, it should not feel like a totally different experience.

That means that delivery processes must become like a product for the business, with all the traits of a product:

- clear and easy to use
- usable/adaptable in multiple contexts
- designed to fit clear user needs
- feedback and review baked in
- adaptation and improvement as a feature

However, it’s easy to confuse the focus between processes vs. outcomes. Customers want something done to achieve something specific. The delivery processes are only the means of enabling that.

The delivery principal must hold the tension in a fundamental balancing act between:

- systematic and thoroughgoing processes on the one hand, and
- space for creativity, innovation and situational agility on the other.

Achieving outcomes for customers is a ‘one team’ collaboration between all the experts — in the business and the customer —  enabled by the delivery lead.
