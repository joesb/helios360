As the business matures, it stretches forward towards greater professionalism.

Every business wants to exude a professional air, but what constitutes professionalism is often taken on assumed knowledge rather than stated explicitly.

## The point of professionalism

There's three intentions when professionalising what the business does, from the perspective of project delivery leadership.

### 1. Calmness

Things often become frenetic in organisations. Signing lots of new contracts one on top of another; sudden growth arising from a round of funding; a buyout or merger; challenging client relationships; unexpected churn or staff turnover — all can create chaotic conditions for delivering customer outcomes.

The CDO's role is to usher in calmness when things would otherwise be frenzied. Professionalism is the means of achieving that, with mature and methodical systems or actions to handle these turbulent situations.

In these situations, the Chief Delivery Officer's own calmness is contagious and will spread quickly to clients, to the team, and to the wider business.

### 2. Confidence

A capable CDO is a master builder who has seen most things before. That means that even novel situations or events will have a ring of familiarity — aah, it's one of those!

Recognising the shape and characteristics of things breeds a confidence in tackling those challenges with tried and tested practices built on long experience.

### 3. Consistency

These practices and ways of working, smoothed and hardened across a broad set of contexts, allows the business to achieve successful outcomes consistently.

Delivery consistency requires that knowledge, insight, and progress is shared internally also, captured and passed on across the whole delivery unit within the business.

That means thoroughgoing documentation, as the baseline. It also means demonstrations — of client project work and any technical or practical innovations, or other discrete areas of progress in the delivery team. And it means a commitment to standards, and a serious maintenance of those standards too.

## The essence of professionalism

So what are we talking about when we talk of professionalism?

### 1. Ways of working

The processes that you adopt are an encapsulation of how you do you work as an organisation.

That's probably based on a bunch of industry standards, like [Agile project management principles](https://agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/){target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"}, or standards that relate to your company's specialism, discipline, sector, or tech stack.

But it's more than that — it's also a way of formalising the distinct practices that your organisation has adopted and found to be the healthiest and happiest ways for you to organise yourselves and achieve your goals.

### 2. Interactions

Professionalism also determines how you interact together, both internally as a delivery team and as a business, and also how you interact with your clients.

We'll come back to the [importance of excellent communication](/handbook/what/communication-is-key/) in the next section.

### 3. Value delivered

- value created by the sum of the parts
  - value for clients
  - the agency’s standing

### 4. Efficiency

- reducing unnecessary overheads
- managing risks
- forecasts, burndown
- well-run meetings
- the right information at the right time

### 5. Clarity

- everyone understands things at each stage
- easy to inspect
- analyse, adapt, improve

### 6. Tone of voice

We have to make this the best client experience possible

## Professional processes

Professionalism covers many things, but a large part of that is comprehensive, robust, replicable processes that are clear for customers and staff, reflect the organisation’s persona, and are in tight alignment with business objectives. That is true for client delivery just as it is for any other part of the business.

Importantly, the delivery principal should build themselves out of the systems and processes they design. If a customer or project needs to switch delivery personnel for whatever reason, it should not feel like a totally different experience.

That means that delivery processes must become like a product for the business, with all the traits of a product:

- clear and easy to use
- usable/adaptable in multiple contexts
- designed to fit clear user needs
- feedback and review baked in
- adaptation and improvement as a feature

However, it’s easy to confuse the focus between processes vs. outcomes. Customers want something done to achieve something specific. The delivery processes are only the means of enabling that.

The delivery principal must hold the tension in a fundamental balancing act between:

- systematic and thoroughgoing processes on the one hand, and
- space for creativity, innovation and situational agility on the other.

Achieving outcomes for customers is a ‘one team’ collaboration between all the experts — in the business and the customer —  enabled by the delivery lead.
