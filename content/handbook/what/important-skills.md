So, we've established that [communication is the key skill for a delivery principal](/handbook/what/communication-is-key) followed closely by [advocacy, which often looks like diplomacy](/handbook/what/advocacy/). Beyond that, though, what other traits or abilities are important to lead customer delivery?

Here's a list of seven CDO super-powers, and we'll look at each below.

{% ImgFigure 'A hand holding a folder of Top Secret files. <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-person-holding-a-folder-of-a-top-secret-files-label-8371715/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photo</a> by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@cottonbro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cottonbro studio</a> on Pexels.', image.classes %}![A hand holding a folder of Top Secret files](/public/images/source/pexels-cottonbro-8371715.jpg){.image-rounded eleventy:widths="200,350,500,780"}{% endImgFigure %}

## Building relationships

The CDO needs to be a master at relationship building.

Most obviously, projects get done because people do them, and the better those people are connected to the focus and purpose of the task, the higher quality the outcomes. Consequently, fostering personal connection is a vital component of delivering stuff.

There's a wider view, though.

The CDO will need the support of peers in the C-suite to achieve the delivery strategy vision. You will need the help of others in the wider business to execute the delivery strategy effectively: the technical and/or design specialists who engage directly with customer needs; the business's support and success services for ongoing health of what's built for clients; sales and marketing for landing the right kind of customers, and for a coherent persona and customer experience from beginning to end; and so on.

**Rapport**{.text-color-brand-secondary} is essential to nurture long and healthy relationships with customers, of course. You need to connect in order to see the world from their perspective, to understand their needs and the goals their aiming to achieve, and for the client to trust that you're focused on the right outcomes for them.

Occasionally, the CDO will need to go toe-to-toe with colleagues to advocate for things that are important or to achieve certain necessary ends. But the most effective results will be achieved through building strong and healthy interpersonal connections.

### The power of cake{.margin-block-start-vlg}

It's astonishingly important to spend social time with people.

{% ImgFigure 'Women eating cakes and looking at a cellphone. <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/women-eating-cakes-and-looking-at-a-cellphone-4347208/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photo</a> by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@edmond-dantes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edmond Dantès</a> on Pexels.', image.side_classes %}![Women eating cakes and looking at a cellphone](/public/images/source/pexels-edmond-dantes-4347208.jpg){.image-rounded eleventy:widths="200,350"}{% endImgFigure %}

Taking time out to share a piece of cake, to have a coffee with a colleague, or breakfast, or if food's not your thing then going for a walk together — it's powerful.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

Informal settings put everyone at ease, and vital to take time to talk informally, about wider topics — hopes and dreams, frustrations and challenges, personal stories of how we got here, what matters to us, what keeps us awake at night, and so on — to help build strong bonds.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

It helps to understand what motivates people. It creates safety to talk about struggles or difficulties. It opens up new insights into ways that you can help.

Cake is powerful.

### Building trust{.margin-block-start-vlg}

Clients and people in your own organisation, at all levels, alike will need to trust you. At times, they will need to have faith in you to make judgement calls.

Trust is especially important when taking on big or risky challenges with lots at stake.

Trust doesn't come from nowhere. It's not a switch to be just turned on.

It derives from consistency, honesty, and reliability, from behaving with empathy and consideration, and it requires transparency in actions and decisions.

In other words, the trust that a Chief Delivery Officer has to rely on means they must be a person of **integrity**{.text-color-brand-secondary}.

### Building respect{.margin-block-start-vlg}

Respect is reciprocal.

As you give respect — to your customer and the specialists in their team, and to your colleagues and peers in your own company, the experts you have around you — and both display and act with empathy and understanding to their situation and context, so you will be given respect in return.

In particular, this is about recognising expertise in other people.

As a CDO or a delivery lead of any kind, you do not need to be the fount of all knowledge, and it's not your job to determine what needs to be done.

Instead, your role is to facilitate a collaborative effort. You convene a group of capable and experienced people to pool their wisdom and their efforts together in order to reach a particular, shared outcome.

The heart of that is respect — the effectiveness of that collaborative venture is determined in large part by the high regard a team of people with great expertise show to each other.

Build respect, then, and you lay the ground to achieve great things.

## Strategic vision, tactical view

As with many aspects of the CDO role, being able to hold a creative tension between strategy and execution is a distinctive quality.

{% ImgFigure 'Hiker exploring in Torres del Paine, Chile. <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/exploring-17301681/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photo</a> by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@marek-piwnicki-3907296/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marek Piwnicki</a>.', image.side_classes %}![Hiker exploring in Torres del Paine, Chile](/public/images/source/pexels-marek-piwnicki-3907296-17301681.jpg){.image-rounded eleventy:widths="200,350"}{% endImgFigure %}

The role requires you to do both — to see far ahead, and determine how to get where you're going; and, to take one step at a time on the path you've set, without getting distracted or discouraged.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

Or, to put it differently, it's about altitudes of thinking — taking the time to stand on higher ground to get the long view, whilst knowing that things are put into action back at ground level.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

### Strategy: Walk up the hill to see the horizon

You'll be familiar, from your long experience of running customer projects, how important it is to start with a focus on the outcomes and to keep that focus all the way through. The same is true when working out how the business should be interacting with customers and delivering on its promises.

At ground level, things can appear quite suddenly and erratically, almost as if out of nowhere. That'll cause you big problems, as if you're always putting in effort just to stand still. And it's because your view is too short — the horizon is very close, where things can hit you without much warning.

You need to get to higher ground where the horizon is further out and your view is both longer and broader, taking in the landscape all around you.

From higher ground you'll have a clearer view of your objective, and of the lay of the land in between, the immovable objects that have to be dealt with, the rivers, forests, canyons, and so on. From this loftier view, you'll be able to work out the best path to get to your goal.

You'll also have a better perspective on things that are moving, the weather, the challenges or opposition that may impede you on your way, etc.

This drawn-out metaphor is what *strategy*{.text-color-brand-secondary} is all about.

- Keep focused on the end-goal, on the outcome you want
- Take account of what's immovable in between
- Evaluate what's moving, and understand the risk it poses on your path
- Choose the optimum route to get to that destination
- Work out a plan for the journey you're going to take
- Test that plan as thoroughly as you can, so you're not unduly surprised
- Break the whole thing down into achievable steps
- Work out how you're going to know how you're getting on when your vision isn't as clear, when things get tough
- Put in place the team and the equipment you'll need along the way

You can only do all this if you take yourself off up the hill first.

### Tactics: Ground work at ground level

Lovely though the views are, you're static on the mountain top. The journey doesn't happen here.

To get stuff done you have to come back down to ground level.

If you've put in good planning time, then you'll have a clear step-by-step directions to follow. You'll definitely know the landmarks and way-points. But should know a lot more than that, something close to a turn-by-turn guide to follow.

One of the things you should have identified is the challenges and risks to your big venture. In your thorough planning, you'll have worked out how you're going to tackle particular obstacles, the bigger challenges you know are on your path ahead.

This is the definition of *tactics*{.text-color-brand-secondary}, pretty much — how you're going to address specific things that are part of the larger plan, the distinct things you need to achieve or overcome in order to get where you're going.

Your tactics are the hard work you do at ground level, in the day to day. And your tactics are the reason why you've drawn together this specific the team and these particular tools — so that you can handle what you know is coming at you.

{% Note true, "content-note-info", "yes" %}
**Note:**{.h3-style}
{.border-bottom .margin-block-end-lg}

*Strategy should always come first.*{.larger}

Tactics (i.e. coordinated action taken in a *specific* situation) will be fairly impotent, or worse, a potential liability, without reference to a larger context that gives them meaning.

Tactics need to be *directed* toward a *goal or outcome* in order to have *focus and purpose*.

*Tactics *depend* on strategy.*{.larger}

{% endNote %}

#### Beware of too much improvisation, too often

Often the term 'tactics' is used as a synonym of 'improvise', but that's not really right. Yes, occasionally you will have to react, to be spontaneous. But if you're doing that too often then it's a strong clue that you didn't spend long enough at high altitude, that you were impatient.

If that's the case, you probably have a fundamental flaw to deal with.

Pause.

And go back up the hill.

### Master for solving problems

That said, problem-solving is a core constituent of delivery leadership, and excellent CDOs will be exceptional in this area. The skill is equally important when analysing your challenges and planning out how you'll address them as it is when needing to adapt to an obstruction on the fly.

Part of your credibility ([discussed below](#credibility) in more depth) is your own pre-existing expertise in the organisation's industry, sector, and core business. You may also have important experience from a distinct specialism, data or design or engineering, say. You will undoubtedly lean on that history and long experience when tackling difficult problems — the pattern of thinking about problems that you've acquired over your career to date are transferable skills and will remain vital.

The problems you'll experience when building your delivery strategy and executing on it will be approached in the same way:

- define the problem;
- analyse it;
- generate solutions;
- evaluate them;
- select one (or two) as promising options;
  - determine how you'll know it's a valid fix;
- try out your options;
  - (depending on the scale, you may just skip straight on [small] or run a pilot [large])
- implement the best;
- measure the impact and make adjustments.

You know how it goes.

### Catalyst for change

If you're the first CDO the organisation has taken on, it's inevitable that you'll be the author of substantial change in the business. If you're a successor to a previous incumbent, change is still probably your watchword as you evaluate and revise — to whatever degree — the way the organisation delivers for its customers.

Enabling change depends on all of the dimensions discussed here.

In particular, it requires you to have strong and [healthy working relationships](#building-relationships) with colleagues across the business — not only will they be a vital support for what you're aiming to do, but in certain areas you'll need direct help as you transform the things that need transforming.

It also leans heavily on your [potent skills of communication](/handbook/what/communication-is-key/), which we've already discussed at length — you'll need to be painting pictures about what you're changing, why you're changing it, how things will change, what that means for everyone, what difference it'll make and how it'll help, and so on, all the way through. Don't underestimate the need to communicate, and to keep on communicating, as you embed the transformation you're aiming for.

Of course, it won't all be plain sailing, and we'll talk about the quality of [resilience](#calm-under-pressure) below.

### Think slow, act fast

This is one of the [key heuristics for delivery leadership](/handbook/delivery/heuristics/) that you'll already know well, but when doing stuff it's vital to take time up front to think things through thoroughly before you get on with implementing things.

You can boil all that down into a single phrase, coined by [Bent Flyvbjerg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flyvbjerg/){target=_blank rel="noreferrer nofollow"}, the project management guru and Professor of Major Program Management:

> Think slow, act fast
{.bq-alt}

See Flyberg's book, [*How Big Things Get Done*](https://sites.prh.com/how-big-things-get-done-book){target=_blank rel="noreferrer nofollow"} for all the deep thinking behind this pithy phrase.{.smaller .margin-inline-start-lg}

It's cheaper and quicker to find problems and see things fail when you're still planning your work. Reduce uncertainty with low-cost research, testing, prototyping, and then roll those insights into better planning.

Then, *move quickly and deliver rapidly* based on the thoroughgoing plans you've made. The longer you spend in the execution and the slower you move at this stage, the more space it gives for things being adapted — either needing to, or being forced to.

If change is foreseen or forced on you, then Agile methodologies are extremely helpful.

## Structured thinking

Strong organisational skills are one of the most important dimensions of your work as a CDO, and these are something that will have been a feature of your career all along, no doubt.

{% ImgFigure 'Close-up shot of a person pointing at an evidence board. <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/close-up-shot-of-a-person-pointing-at-evidence-board-8369524/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photo</a> by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@cottonbro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cottonbro studio</a>.', image.side_classes %}![Close-up shot of a person pointing at an evidence board](/public/images/source/pexels-cottonbro-8369524.jpg){.image-rounded eleventy:widths="200,350"}{% endImgFigure %}

But organisational skills are functional skills that need to be focussed through a specific lens that we might call *structured thinking* — the ability to …{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

- tackle difficult things methodically,
- to analyse demands, needs, situations and more in a systematic manner, and
- to work with reasoning, likely with reference to a framework, towards usable solutions or outcomes.
{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

Let's explore this in more depth.

### Analytical

The analytical mindset is about taking a set of information —  whether succinct, such as business goals or client objectives, or loose and open, such as usage or performance data, or user needs from interviews, say — and performing several actions on it.

Analytical approaches then do two things.

**First**, they decompose that information into smaller elements, maybe even into constituent parts. Complex things are tackled more easily when they are broken into smaller pieces. Although the whole thing operates together as a unit, the effect of the whole is achieved by the traits and characteristics contributed by the components.

**And secondly**, analysis requires that individual significance AND the relative importance of each part is identified. What does each part do? Why is it important? And how should the effect of each be weighed in relation to the other parts?

### Systematic

Complex information then needs to be addressed in a logical manner, piece by piece.

Being systematic means that your analysis covers each element and gives it the attention it deserves. Being methodical allows you to be appropriately thorough.

### Focused on usable processes

As you construct processes, tools and practices for your business, it's essential that they sit aside from you as the CDO. They cannot, they must not depend on you to be implemented in practice.

Delivery processes need to be replicable by others in the business. Ideally, they should be usable by people who aren't delivery management specialists — designed to be used by non-specialists.

If a project or a customer needs to switch the project manager for any reason (illness, scale, personality, sector specialism, whatever) it should not feel like totally different delivery experience.

## Credibility

The art of [building relationships](#building-relationships) discussed above is built in part on credibility.

{% ImgFigure 'Group of people listening intently to a presentation. <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/group-of-people-listening-intently-to-a-presentation-18999533/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photo</a> by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@bertellifotografia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matheus Bertelli</a>.', image.side_classes %}![Group of people listening intently to a presentation](/public/images/source/pexels-bertellifotografia-18999533.jpg){.image-rounded eleventy:widths="200,350"}{% endImgFigure %}

A CDO must be credible to the CEO, the founder(s) and the board, their colleagues, the business as a whole, and vitally, to customers.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

The business as a whole needs to be confident in the CDO, especially as they introduce (potentially) big ideas and significant changes — credibility is essential.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

### Credibility and knowledge

A large degree of your credibility will be derived from specialist knowledge.

A new CDO will need to have a thorough understanding of delivery methodologies and frameworks, both theoretical and practical. And you need a thirst to learn more, to keep up with innovations in the field, reading articles and books, attending conferences, and so on. But that isn't enough.

Credibility also benefits from a good working knowledge of the field, sector, or specialism of the business. The better you understand the challenges and needs of the delivery teams you're overseeing, and the optimum working context of the experts in your teams, the better you are able to serve and support them. If you're leading digital engineering delivery work, for instance, then a background as an engineer, programmer, system admin, or similar is hugely advantageous. The same if it's a design business, a marketing agency, and so on.

In many cases, you will need to be a translator, between customer, business, and team. Each will need to feel they are represented, that you're not necessarily on anyone's 'side' in particular (see previously, on being [the ultimate advocate](/handbook/what/advocacy/)) — you are on the side of outcomes … and those don't flourish in silos! You can only do that if your knowledge of the business's specialism is rock solid.

### Credibility and authority

High performance CDOs must have authority.

But the only true and valid authority derives from credibility. Authority is established through credibility, rather than the other way around.

Ideally, authority to effect change and implement practices that affect the whole business will be projected through clear support from above. But without credibility, that will quickly ring hollow.

Be consistent, stay focused — the credibility will build itself.

---

## People-centric

Delivery leadership is many things, but it is particularly people-centred.

You may be making sure customer's get what they're trying to achieve, overseeing processes and practices, setting standards and making sure they're maintained, and so on … but all of that involves people — your customers and their teams; everyone in your delivery teams; the wider business, the leadership, and other colleagues.

### Especially high emotional intelligence (EQ)

An essential quality of a high performing Chief Delivery Officer is that they have *unusually high emotional intelligence* — the ability to perceive, understand, and manage emotions in one's self and in others. It's what helps you to maintain composure under stress rather than jump off the deep end.

There's several reasons why high EQ is a vital trait for a CDO, some of which we've touched on above. In particular:

- The delivery process is, in part, an expression of the character of the business — it's your job to work out how to do that best
- You'll need to influence people with authenticity — so they follow your leadership, and so that you can effect change
- Things will get escalated to you — challenges in projects, with customers, amongst team members, etc. — and you'll need to handle and resolve these challenges

So, what does a high EQ look like? There's many characteristics of someone with high emotional intelligence, but here's 12 that should be at the forefront.

If you're a CDO already, these are probably things you'll recognise. If you're aspiring to a CDO role, these are traits for you to consider in particular. If you're looking to hire a CDO, these are qualities you should be looking out for in the appointment process:

1. **Self-awareness**{.h4-style .text-color-brand-secondary}
    Being highly aware of one's own emotions, behaviours, responses, triggers, and patterns, sensitive to one's emotional state at any given moment and able keep a check on one's self.
2. **Self-knowledge**{.h4-style .text-color-brand-secondary}
    Reflecting on ourselves and our history leads to a deeper awareness of who we are as human beings, including our strengths, weaknesses, values, and level of integrity. This may uncover things we’d rather not acknowledge.
3. **Self-effacing**{.h4-style .text-color-brand-secondary}
    Confident and standing up for opinions or principles, but recognising that you don’t know everything and being willing to learn from others, not seeking praise or requiring affirmation in order to pursue something.
4. **Empathetic**{.h4-style .text-color-brand-secondary}
    Perceive, understand, and sense other people’s emotions, feelings, moods, and perspectives, requiring social awareness and reading social cues, body language, and other forms of communication.
5. **Strong impulse control**{.h4-style .text-color-brand-secondary}
    An advanced trait that involves your ability to control, regulate, and manage your emotions, impulses, and behaviour.
6. **Self-disciplined**{.h4-style .text-color-brand-secondary}
    Exerting control over trains of thought and mental states leading to self-regulation and discipline towards difficult tasks, goals, and long-term achievements.
7. **Authentic**{.h4-style .text-color-brand-secondary}
    Someone who is open, genuine, and true to themselves, full of integrity such that they're the same person sliced in any direction.
8. **Resilient**{.h4-style .text-color-brand-secondary}
    Someone who is difficult to offend, having a thicker skin than usual, who is aware of other people’s emotions and psychology, and understands when not to take things personally.
9. **Adaptable**{.h4-style .text-color-brand-secondary}
    Adjusting well to changes, understanding how to respond to new environments, and can adapt their social approaches to suit other people’s needs.
10. **Taking a moment to think**{.h4-style .text-color-brand-secondary}
    Able to pause, reflect, and compose one's self before reacting, being especially aware of emotional triggers.
11. **Able to apologise**{.h4-style .text-color-brand-secondary}
    Courageous and confident enough to apologise, swallowing one's pride, with apologies that are sincere, heartfelt, and meaningful – not dismissive, fake, or filled with gaslighting.
{.bullet-list-secondary-color .bullet-list-bold}
12. **Good with feedback**{.h4-style .text-color-brand-secondary}
    Feedback is tricky — both giving and receiving — yet also essential for success. It can be sensitive and personal, especially when talking about something difficult, and managing emotions is vital.

### Cheerleader for people and initiatives

A CDO is playing a team sport, and high performance teams play at their best when they have all the means necessary to be their best self.

#### Cheerleader for people

An effective CDO is looking out for every person in their team. There's several dimensions to this.

**Firstly, noticing what they're up to.**{.text-color-brand-secondary} When there's notable things they achieve, a high performing CDO will point that out. They will always aim to say that to them personally, one to one. But often it's also important to do that in a public forum, to note what they've done or contributed and thank that person so that peers and colleagues see that public praise as well — in a shared communication space, like a chat channel, internal newsletter or group email, say.

Ideally, you'll be doing that for people outside your immediate team(s) as well — there's plenty of places and spaces where larger internal groups are convened, for multifunction initiatives or 'town hall' events, for instance.

And where you can, it's good to do that for your customer and their team members, too. Notice things, and say a personal and a public thanks to them … and make sure that's passed up their management chain too, if you can.

**Secondly, the CDO has the back of everyone in their team.**{.text-color-brand-secondary} When there's difficulties of whatever sort, the CDO is there and able to lend a hand.

That may mean helping directly, or finding others who can. But that also means making sure the burden is shared and no one is struggling or suffering alone.

**And thirdly, the effective CDO is looking for the best for their team.**{.text-color-brand-secondary} That means looking our for opportunities — to try out something new, to participate in an initiative, say, or work alongside someone who can help them take a step up; to get some training, attend a course or class, or present at a conference, maybe.

#### Cheerleader for initiatives

A capable CDO is also hunting out problems and then looking for ways to solve them. We'll look at 'problem-sourcing' as a practice or methodology elsewhere, but for now we'll just say that it is just as important if this is a something that comes from someone in the team as anywhere else, just as useful if it's a 'this is an annoying/frustrating thing, grr,' or if it's an 'oooh, this looks like an interesting/novel way to raise our game' thing.

Some may only need small tweaks, but others may require a larger approach. Where that's the case, you'll probably need to dedicate some time, people, and resources to it. And when there's an initiative to respond to a problem, it needs the weight of your position to give it support and to champion its outcomes.

### Recruiting good people

You'll also need to recruit people, good people, to join your team and your company. Running effective appointment processes is key to this.

There's lots to say on this, most of it is stuff that has already been said well elsewhere. What I would say in particular is that 'structured interviews' are especially powerful, and I'm a rather big fan of 'situational structured interviews'. In essence, structured interviews try to make it possible to compare apples with apples by asking the same questions to each candidate. Situational questions try to prevent people gaming the interview — they ask hypothetical and forward-facing questions, often based on a mini scenario, ‘what would you do … ’, etc., so that candidates use their reasoning rather than just rely on their work history (which privileges the experienced).

If that's something you're unfamiliar with, I highly recommend you do some reading to find out about it — this [introduction to structured interviews from Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/structured-interviews){target=_blank rel="noreferrer nofollow"} is as good a place to start as anywhere, but do please read further than that.
