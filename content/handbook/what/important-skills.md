So, we've established that [communication is the key skill for a delivery principal](/handbook/what/communication-is-key). Beyond that, though, what other traits or abilities are important to lead customer delivery?

Here's a list of seven CDO super-powers, and we'll look at each below.

## Building relationships

The CDO needs to be a master at relationship building.

Most obviously, projects get done because people do them, and the better those people are connected to the focus and purpose of the task, the higher quality the outcomes. Consequently, fostering personal connection is a vital component of delivering stuff.

There's a wider view, though.

The CDO will need the support of peers in the C-suite to achieve the delivery strategy vision. You will need the help of others in the wider business to execute the delivery strategy effectively: the technical and/or design specialists who engage directly with customer needs; the business's support and success services for ongoing health of what's built for clients; sales and marketing for landing the right kind of customers, and for a coherent persona and customer experience from beginning to end; and so on.

**Rapport**{.text-color-brand-secondary} is essential to nurture long and healthy relationships with customers, of course. You need to connect in order to see the world from their perspective, to understand their needs and the goals their aiming to achieve, and for the client to trust that you're focused on the right outcomes for them.

Occasionally, the CDO will need to go toe-to-toe with colleagues to advocate for things that are important or to achieve certain necessary ends. But the most effective results will be achieved through building strong and healthy interpersonal connections.

### Building trust{.margin-block-start-vlg}

Clients and people in your own organisation, at all levels, alike will need to trust you. At times, they will need to have faith in you to make judgement calls.

Trust is especially important when taking on big or risky challenges with lots at stake.

Trust doesn't come from nowhere. It's not a switch to be just turned on.

It derives from consistency, honesty, and reliability, from behaving with empathy and consideration, and it requires transparency in actions and decisions.

In other words, the trust that a Chief Delivery Officer has to rely on means they must be a person of **integrity**{.text-color-brand-secondary}.

### Building respect{.margin-block-start-vlg}

Respect is reciprocal.

As you give respect — to your customer and the specialists in their team, and to your colleagues and peers in your own company, the experts you have around you — and both display and act with empathy and understanding to their situation and context, so you will be given respect in return.

In particular, this is about recognising expertise in other people.

As a CDO or a delivery lead of any kind, you do not need to be the fount of all knowledge, and it's not your job to determine what needs to be done.

Instead, your role is to facilitate a collaborative effort. You convene a group of capable and experienced people to pool their wisdom and their efforts together in order to reach a particular, shared outcome.

The heart of that is respect — the effectiveness of that collaborative venture is determined in large part by the high regard a team of people with great expertise show to each other.

Build respect, then, and you lay the ground to achieve great things.
