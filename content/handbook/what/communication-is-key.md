Communication is a key skill for every role in the C-suite, but for a Chief Delivery Officer (and for anyone leading delivery teams) communication is so important that it merits its own discussion.

Communication skills are vital for anyone responsible for delivery, but the Chief Delivery Officer gives leadership for how it's done, setting the example for others to follow, providing a model and giving support.

It's a multidimensional quality, involving spoken and written communication, high competence in asking questions, excellence in listening, deep emotional intelligence, strong capability in presenting coherently to large audiences, facilitating in workshops, giving leadership to teams, talking openly with groups, and sharing in one-to-one contexts also.

Excellence in communication is an essential quality for a CDO.

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The CDO needs to give *clarity* at all points of a project's lifecycle, so that everyone with a concern can understand what's being done currently, what's already been done, what's going to be done next, and what will be done in due course â€” and why.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} You will need to offer *understanding*, making hard or complex subjects, often technical ones, intelligible and engaging for non-specialists, frequently with the aim of winning hearts and minds for taking a particular path together.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The CDO needs to be able to *translate* things between contexts, to talk in the appropriate language of the audience, so that everyone can understand what they need know and can help in the way that is needed, whether that's the customer themselves or their project team, the stakeholders of the project, the delivery team themselves, other parts of the company (in product, say, or design, technology or engineering, UX, sales, or wherever), or the company's management or exec team.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The ability to *pitch* at an appropriate level is essential. When bringing a team together, the CDO will need to pitch the project and its goals to bring people onboard. Especially at early stages of a delivery project, but equally at later points too, the CDO will need to present the way the delivery team (and wider business) understands the customer's problem(s) and the solution(s) to address it.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The CDO will need to be *credible* when communicating with business decision-makers, both on the customer's side and C-suite or leadership team itself, presenting the objectives, the route to take to get there, together with the rationale, the implications, the risks and the benefits.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The CDO needs to communicate effectively with *experts*, whether on a given subject matter, a technology or platform, a process, or whatever.{.padding-inline-start-lg}
