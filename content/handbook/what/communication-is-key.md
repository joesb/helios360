  Clear and coherent communication is a fundamental requirement for a Chief Delivery Officer, an essential skill that should be particularly well developed.
  
  The CDO is responsible for effective communication between all parties on projects: clear communication is vital to achieve outcomes. The CDO determines what and how a business communicates with customers and stakeholders. And so the the CDO should show distinctive leadership in this key area.{.smaller}

Communication is a key skill for every role in the C-suite, but for a Chief Delivery Officer (and for anyone leading delivery teams) communication is so important that it merits its own discussion.

Communication skills are vital for anyone responsible for delivery, but the Chief Delivery Officer gives leadership for how it's done, setting the example for others to follow, providing a model and giving support.

It's a multidimensional quality, involving spoken and written communication, high competence in asking questions, excellence in listening, deep emotional intelligence, strong capability in presenting coherently to large audiences, facilitating in workshops, giving leadership to teams, talking openly with groups, and sharing in one-to-one contexts also.

## The breadth of communication skills

Excellence in communication is an essential quality for a CDO.

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The CDO needs to give *clarity* at all points of a project's lifecycle, so that everyone with a concern can understand what's being done currently, what's already been done, what's going to be done next, what will be done in due course, what won't be done â€” and why.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} You will need to offer *understanding*, making hard or complex subjects, often technical ones, intelligible and engaging for non-specialists, frequently with the aim of winning hearts and minds for taking a particular path together.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The CDO needs to be able to *translate* things between contexts, to talk in the appropriate language of the audience, so that everyone can understand what they need know and can help in the way that is needed, whether that's the customer themselves or their project team, the stakeholders of the project, the delivery team themselves, other parts of the company (in product, say, or design, technology or engineering, UX, sales, or wherever), or the company's management or exec team.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The ability to *pitch* at an appropriate level is essential. When bringing a team together, the CDO will need to pitch the project and its goals to bring people onboard. Especially at early stages of a delivery project, but equally at later points too, the CDO will need to present the way the delivery team (and wider business) understands the customer's problem(s) and the solution(s) to address it.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The CDO will need to be *credible* when communicating with business decision-makers, both on the customer's side and C-suite or leadership team itself, presenting the objectives, the route to take to get there, together with the rationale, the implications, the risks and the benefits.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The CDO needs to communicate with *experts* effectively and credibly, whether on a given subject matter, a technology or platform, a process, or something else, understanding their domain, seeking clarification and conformation and absorbing that knowledge to make use of it as appropriate.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} A CDO will need to lean on a deep *emotional intelligence*, understanding what individuals, team members and whole groups both want and need. In particular, the CDO will need to be able to perceive often what is not being said, to project one's self into another person's experience and discern how they may be feeling, how things will be heard from their point of view, or the challenges they may be facing. Often times, it is important to do this ahead of time, to anticipate how things could land and to act in advance accordingly and with wisdom.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

A Chief Delivery Officer needs an unusually comprehensive skillset in this area of communication.

This overview is a helpful way to start understanding the subject, but we'll turn now to look at what this means in the different settings of service and project delivery, what communication skills are required in the context of:

- the customers
- leading the delivery team
- drawing together 'one team' to deliver projects
- supporting individuals
- the wider business

One thing to consider first, though.

### Communication with multiple intelligences

In the 1970s and '80s, developmental psychologist Howard Gardner proposed the idea that human intelligence shows signs of several distinguishable different types, rather than having a singular general intelligence. To capture the full range of abilities and talents that people possess, Gardner proposed that individuals might display strengths, preferences, or particular competencies in a set of intelligence types he had identified:

1. Visualâ€“spatial
2. Linguisticâ€“verbal
3. Logicalâ€“mathematical
4. Bodyâ€“kinesthetic
5. Musical
6. Interpersonal
7. Intrapersonal
8. Naturalistic

A ninth, 'existentialâ€“moral' has also been proposed.

Usually, people will favour anything from 2 to 4 of these types. Most will make use of all to some degree, though everyone will undoubtedly find some particularly hard. Rarely would anyone depend on one type alone.

There's no need to discuss Gardner's [theory of multiple intelligences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences){target=_blank rel="nofollow ugc noreferrer"} fully here (though [reading further on multiple intelligences](https://www.verywellmind.com/gardners-theory-of-multiple-intelligences-2795161){target=_blank rel="nofollow ugc noreferrer"} could be rewarding), and certainly the thesis has [important criticisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences#Criticism){target=_blank rel="nofollow ugc noreferrer"} that should temper an overblown enthusiasm for the concept.

Nonetheless, there are some helpful insights to learn and absorb without needing to adopt Gardner's theory wholesale.

- People are not uniform. What works well for one person will not work well for another.
- This simple-powerful understanding is as important in communication as it is in any other work task.
  - In the knowledge economy, even more so.
- It is also as important for people en masse, in group settings, as it is on an individual scale.
- In essence, this means that the medium and context of what is being covered is every bit as important as the subject itself. For example:
  - Some will absorb things by being told; others just can't do that at all.
  - Some need to touch or move a thing to understand it; others need to see it visually.
  - Some comprehend things by talking them over; others need to take them away and work with it in their own time.
  - And so on.
- When communicating, either individually or en masse, with synchronously (in real time, in a meeting or event, say) or asynchronously (catching up in a recording, reading a document or email or message, say), it's helpful to conceive of several ways to put across the subject or the important information.
  - If you only communicate in spoken work, in person, then that makes things difficult for those who need time and space to read.
  - If you only communicate in words then that makes things difficult for those who need to see pictures and diagrams.
  - If you only present things once in a static form then that makes things hard for people who need to interact with a thing to understand it.
  - And so on.

Effective communicators will use multiple modes of communicating simultaneously so that their audience will be able to engage in the form that works best for them. They may even use modes of communication that can be used at the time and afterwards as well.

Gifted communicators will know their audience and perceive their favoured intelligence type(s) and speak with them in that mode.

The most gifted communicators will have their audience think that they are speaking with someone like them â€” the person sounds like them because their communication is fully rounded and makes strong and healthy use simultaneously of as many modes as possible.
