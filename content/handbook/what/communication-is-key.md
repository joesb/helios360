  Clear and coherent communication is a fundamental requirement for a Chief Delivery Officer, an essential skill that should be particularly well developed.
  
  The CDO is responsible for effective communication between all parties on projects: clear communication is vital to achieve outcomes. The CDO determines what and how a business communicates with customers and stakeholders. And so the the CDO should show distinctive leadership in this key area.{.smaller}

Communication is a key skill for every role in the C-suite, but for a Chief Delivery Officer (and for anyone leading delivery teams) communication is so important that it merits its own discussion.

Communication skills are vital for anyone responsible for delivery, but the Chief Delivery Officer gives leadership for how it's done, setting the example for others to follow, providing a model and giving support.

It's a multidimensional quality, involving spoken and written communication, high competence in asking questions, excellence in listening, deep emotional intelligence, strong capability in presenting coherently to large audiences, facilitating in workshops, giving leadership to teams, talking openly with groups, and sharing in one-to-one contexts also.

## The breadth of communication skills

Excellence in communication is an essential quality for a CDO.

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The CDO needs to give *clarity* at all points of a project's lifecycle, so that everyone with a concern can understand what's being done currently, what's already been done, what's going to be done next, what will be done in due course, what won't be done â€” and why.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} You will need to offer *understanding*, making hard or complex subjects, often technical ones, intelligible and engaging for non-specialists, frequently with the aim of winning hearts and minds for taking a particular path together.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The CDO needs to be able to *translate* things between contexts, to talk in the appropriate language of the audience, so that everyone can understand what they need know and can help in the way that is needed, whether that's the customer themselves or their project team, the stakeholders of the project, the delivery team themselves, other parts of the company (in product, say, or design, technology or engineering, UX, sales, or wherever), or the company's management or exec team.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The ability to *pitch* at an appropriate level is essential. When bringing a team together, the CDO will need to pitch the project and its goals to bring people onboard. Especially at early stages of a delivery project, but equally at later points too, the CDO will need to present the way the delivery team (and wider business) understands the customer's problem(s) and the solution(s) to address it.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The CDO will need to be *credible* when communicating with business decision-makers, both on the customer's side and C-suite or leadership team itself, presenting the objectives, the route to take to get there, together with the rationale, the implications, the risks and the benefits.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} The CDO needs to communicate with *experts* effectively and credibly, whether on a given subject matter, a technology or platform, a process, or something else, understanding their domain, seeking clarification and conformation and absorbing that knowledge to make use of it as appropriate.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} A CDO will need to lean on a deep *emotional intelligence*, understanding what individuals, team members and whole groups both want and need. In particular, the CDO will need to be able to perceive often what is not being said, to project one's self into another person's experience and discern how they may be feeling, how things will be heard from their point of view, or the challenges they may be facing. Often times, it is important to do this ahead of time, to anticipate how things could land and to act in advance accordingly and with wisdom.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

A Chief Delivery Officer needs an unusually comprehensive skillset in this area of communication.

This overview is a helpful way to start understanding the subject, but we'll turn now to look at what this means in the different settings of service and project delivery, what communication skills are required in the context of:

- the customers
- leading the delivery team
- drawing together 'one team' to deliver projects
- supporting individuals
- the wider business

One thing to consider first, though.

### Communication with multiple intelligences

In the 1970s and '80s, developmental psychologist Howard Gardner proposed the idea that human intelligence shows signs of several distinguishable different types, rather than having a singular general intelligence. To capture the full range of abilities and talents that people possess, Gardner proposed that individuals might display strengths, preferences, or particular competencies in a set of intelligence types he had identified:

1. Visualâ€“spatial
2. Linguisticâ€“verbal
3. Logicalâ€“mathematical
4. Bodyâ€“kinaesthetic
5. Musical
6. Interpersonal
7. Intrapersonal
8. Naturalistic

A ninth, 'existentialâ€“moral' has also been proposed.

Usually, people will favour anything from 2 to 4 of these types. Most will make use of all to some degree, though everyone will undoubtedly find some particularly hard. Rarely would anyone depend on one type alone.

There's no need to discuss Gardner's [theory of multiple intelligences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences){target=_blank rel="nofollow ugc noreferrer"} fully here (though [reading further on multiple intelligences](https://www.verywellmind.com/gardners-theory-of-multiple-intelligences-2795161){target=_blank rel="nofollow ugc noreferrer"} could be rewarding), and certainly the thesis has [important criticisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences#Criticism){target=_blank rel="nofollow ugc noreferrer"} that should temper an overblown enthusiasm for the concept.

Nonetheless, there are some helpful insights to learn and absorb without needing to adopt Gardner's theory wholesale.

- People are not uniform. What works well for one person will not work well for another.
- This simple-powerful understanding is as important in communication as it is in any other work task.
  - In the knowledge economy, even more so.
- It is also as important for people en masse, in group settings, as it is on an individual scale.
- In essence, this means that the medium and context of what is being covered is every bit as important as the subject itself. For example:
  - Some will absorb things by being told; others just can't do that at all.
  - Some need to touch or move a thing to understand it; others need to see it visually.
  - Some comprehend things by talking them over; others need to take them away and work with it in their own time.
  - And so on.
- When communicating, either individually or en masse, with synchronously (in real time, in a meeting or event, say) or asynchronously (catching up in a recording, reading a document or email or message, say), it's helpful to conceive of several ways to put across the subject or the important information.
  - If you only communicate in spoken work, in person, then that makes things difficult for those who need time and space to read.
  - If you only communicate in words then that makes things difficult for those who need to see pictures and diagrams.
  - If you only present things once in a static form then that makes things hard for people who need to interact with a thing to understand it.
  - And so on.

Effective communicators will use multiple modes of communicating simultaneously so that their audience will be able to engage in the form that works best for them. They may even use modes of communication that can be used at the time and afterwards as well.

Gifted communicators will know their audience and perceive their favoured intelligence type(s) and speak with them in that mode.

The most gifted communicators will have their audience think that they are speaking with someone like them â€” the person sounds like them because their communication is fully rounded and makes strong and healthy use simultaneously of as many modes as possible.

## Communication with customers

During the delivery phase of any work for customers, the organisation's relationship to it's clients is at its closest. It's vital, then, that the type and quality of communication at this stage is at its highest point.

This is a core duty for a CDO, which means communication of this type has to also be a core skill. The CDO chooses the language, the style, and the format of communication for delivery teams, and this is both a reflection and a representation of the personality of the business.

What we're talking about here is *professionalism* in communication with customers.

### Communicating *how* with customers â€” 'one team'

You are not trying to be the expert in the sector, government or commerce or transport or whatever, when communicating â€” your clients are the experts in their industry.

Rather the objective of your communication as CDO is to bring diverse and divergent skills and expertise together into *one team* â€” you and your people, the customer and their people, and suppliers and their people â€” and enable them to take a task from the very beginning to the very end, consistently.

In terms of communication, that means:

- **at the earliest stages:**
  - deep and patient listening
    - to the expertise of your clients
    - to the experts in your delivery team
  - asking thoroughgoing questions
  - playing it back to be confident in what you've learnt
  - checking, validating and revalidating
  - interpreting and analysing what you've heard â€¦
  - â€¦ so you can turn that into valid plans
  - â€¦ and checking and rechecking the plans are actually valid (more on this later!)
- **at later stages:**
  - explaining
    - the goals and objectives
    - the starting place
    - and the plan for getting from here to there
  - portraying what has been done
  - describing what will be done next
  - preparing what will be done in due course
  - accounting for what won't be done
  - â€¦ and why

There are lots of ways to do this, and the means you choose will depend on lots of things:

- the type of project
- the size (and length) of the project
- the sector or industry for the project
- the persona of the business
- the needs of the delivery team
- your personality and preference(s)
- and more

#### A note on *frequency*

An important component of how you communicate with customers is about the frequency of your communication. There is nothing harder here than some rules of thumb.

**Firstly**{.text-color-brand-secondary}, more transparency is always better than less, and full transparency is the optimum.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

Most projects go wrong because problems are hidden or withheld until it's too late to do anything about them. The more transparent you are able to be, and the earlier and clearer you talk about problems as one team and work what to do about them.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

**Secondly**{.text-color-brand-secondary}, frequent communication makes it easier to make sure things are clear for everyone involved, helps to prevent misunderstanding, and enables the project work to stay on the right track.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

**Thirdly**{.text-color-brand-secondary}, though, a lot of that will be determined by personalities. Part of your role is making sure your delivery team have what they need to get stuff done, and that often means time to focus. So, while a shared direct messaging  channel (e.g. Slack) can seem helpful, if you have particularly chatty, verbose, or opinionated clients that can cause problems. In cases like this, you may need to protect your team's ability to focus and find a different means for clear and frequent communication with the customer.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

### Communicating *what* with customers

We'll cover many of the specifics in [later sections of this *Handbook*](/handbook/outside/), but for now the things you should have in mind might include:

- **the persona you use in written communication**
  - especially in emails, but also,
  - templated items (e.g. 'welcome' packs and messages; slide decks; start/end of sprint/phase documents; etc.), and
  - in written documents (e.g. reports; schedule/scope of work documents; technical documentation; etc.), and
  - in more off-the-cuff formats such in direct messaging platforms (e.g. Slack, etc.)
- **the meetings you arrange, including**
  - the names you choose to use for those events (e.g. kick-off; inception; workshop; consultation; show-and-tell; project status; stakeholder review; etc.), and
  - the frequency of them
  - the openness of and audiences for them
- **the tools you use**
  - open shared folders for project documents
  - project management tools with graphical and/or configurable interfaces for different audiences
  - slide decks from meetings that you share directly and/or export to a permanent document
  - sprint/phase start and end documents
  - key reports at key moments in the overall progress
  - specific reports or data for key stakeholders

We'll return to all of these at various points elsewhere in the *Handbook*.
