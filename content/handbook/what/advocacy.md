  A Chief Delivery Officer sits in a curious, vital place in between the team, the organisation, and its customers, advocating for the needs of each simultaneously. It's a challenging and creative tension.

  CDOs have to be able to engage credibly and effectively with clients at all levels. They need to represent the delivery team, supporting them to do their best work. And they also need to see progress towards the goals of the business. It's a strange, important position to occupy.{.smaller}

As a delivery principal, your role demands that you sit in a peculiar place.

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} On the one hand, you are the face of your organisation that your customer sees during the whole of the delivery phase.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*ðŸ‘‰*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md} On the other, your job is to understand in depth the why and the what of the customer's goals, and work to achieve the right outcome to match those objectives.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

That puts the Chief Delivery Officer in a particularly unusual place, in between two things â€” your organisation and your customer â€” in a place where you're not quite one thing or the other. The CDO has to look both ways:

- to comprehend what the client wants to achieve and represent that to the business so that it can prepare all that's needed to reach those outcomes
- to understand that the business itself has objectives and capabilities, and what it does for its customers has to align with those goals as well

To add complication to this position, both of those things are often irregularly shaped, zigzag and edgy in unexpected places, with unusual or specific needs or practices that need to be respected. Compounding the challenge, those two sets of needs are in competition with each other in many areas, with only a limited number of places where they connect smoothly.

So, the client and the business need the CDO to be an intermediary, to act as the interface between the two.

The word that's most appropriate here is **advocacy**{.text-color-brand-secondary}.

The delivery principal is the advocate for both the organisation and the customer, simultaneously.
