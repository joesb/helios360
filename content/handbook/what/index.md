This section is mostly aimed at the CDO themselves, current or aspiring, whatever title or variation of project management leadership label is given to the role:

- Chief Delivery Officer
- Chief Service Delivery Officer
- Client Services Director
- Professional Services Director, or
- Director, principal, lead, or head of a Project Management Office

Each role name as a distinctive emphasis or indicates a slightly different focus.

Some are more commercial in direction, closer to the sales and account management end of the spectrum. Others focus more on project planning, implementation, and continuous development phases. And others will be more attentive to the live service stage, with concern for support, maintenance, and client satisfaction.

All share things in common, however, and this section explores those commonalities.

The chapter may also be useful for founders and executive teams considering adding a CDO to the organisation:

- What skills and characteristics should you be looking for when you're recruiting someone to this role?

CEOs of professional services businesses understand that the delivery principal sits at the heart of the business, and close to those responsible for the commercial leadership.

It's a vital position with an overview of outcomes for customers, setting and maintaining the processes and practices of client delivery, providing a safe space for creativity, and a place in which expertise can shine.

Highly effective CEOs recognise the role of delivery director is a strange one though, serving the needs of the customer, the team, and the business simultaneously in creative tension.
