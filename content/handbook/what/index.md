This section is mostly aimed at the Chief Delivery Officer themselves, current or aspiring, whatever title is given to the role — Chief Service Delivery Officer (CSDO); Client Services Director (CSD); Professional Services Directors (PSD); or lead or head of a Project Management Office (PMO). But the chapter may also be useful for founders and executive teams considering adding a CDO to the organisation — what skills and characteristics should you be looking for when you're recruiting someone to this role?
