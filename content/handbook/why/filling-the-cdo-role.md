  The Chief Delivery Officer role is one of the hardest to hire for.
  
  You can promote from within rather than recruit into position. You can support an individual to grow and develop into the role. BUT … the person you need at 10 people is not the person you need at 30, 75, 300, 1,000, etc.

When appointing for the role of delivery principal you're looking for a very special set of traits and capabilities. Those are discussed in detail the [What makes a CDO?](/handbook/what/) section. For now, it's important to establish that there's a fundamental set of soft and hard skills that have to intersect in a high performance Chief Delivery Officer.

To complicate things more, the person who fills this role often plays a crucial part in the growth and development of the business.

Consequently, filling this role is both very important and very challenging.

I spoke to several CEOs/founders to hear their specific experiences of appointing someone to the role of delivery principal. This section is largely taken from their insights.

## The CDO and the growing business

The particular mix of characteristics and strengths needed in this position in the business is necessarily different at each stage of growth — what you need from this role in a 10–20-person business is very different from what you need in a 30–50-person business, or in a 80–120-person business, a 300-person business, a 1,000-person business and so on.

Whilst the role may demand firefighting from time to time, care should be taken not to appoint people who thrive in chaos. As the business grows, consistency becomes increasingly important.{.emphasis}

## Promoting from within vs. hiring into position

Many agencies have supported someone already in post to grow their skills and capabilities for the role as the business has grown, though most reported that it has proved problematic.

Recruitment specifically for the position has been more fruitful.
