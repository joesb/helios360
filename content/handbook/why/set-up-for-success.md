  Before you hire a Client Services Director or Chief Delivery Officer or take on the role in a business yourself, there's some key questions that you need to ask yourself about the position and why it's important to you.

  The answers to these questions will give the CDO the best chance for positive impact on the business, your team, and your clients.

Before you become or you hire a Chief Delivery Officer, you need to consider the following questions and know how the business is going to answer them.

1. What do you want your Chief Delivery Officer to achieve?
2. Where will they go in the organisation?
3. At what level of seniority will they sit?
4. What and how are you going to invest in customer delivery?

You need to have worked through the first question before you can make progress with to the other three, and hopefully this *Handbook* will help you to wrestle with the issues this question poses. The answers to the subsequent three questions will determine the reach and scope that the CDO will have. Even the best CDO around will be able to have little impact if they are stuck in the day-to-day of specific customer project work and never get the chance to stand on higher ground, to take the time to survey the horizon and build plans.

Here, then, are some initial pointers for ways you can think about these things so that the CDO and the organisation are both set up for success.

## This or that

We'll discuss terminology below, but for now let's consider the several aspects of client-facing roles, what's similar or shared between them, and what's distinctive about customer delivery. With that in mind it will be clearer to understand if and why customer delivery could or should be separated out from other roles, which will then help to determine what you want your Chief Delivery Officer to achieve.

Whilst the sales portion of the business interacts with your customers, until they move out of the 'prospect' phase and move closer towards that 'pre-contract' phase then a customer, in truth, isn't really a customer. This latter stage of the customer journey is often referred to as pre-sales, characterised by demonstrations and technical reviews, evaluations and trials, and so on. It's fair to say then that this pre-sales stage is a customer-facing role, even though it's part of the sales experience of the customer journey.

There's also an important part of the customer journey that (usually) follows on from the project delivery stage, once the work you've done for your client is in live service, whether that's a digital tool or system in live usage, a marketing strategy that's being implemented, a brand in action, or whatever. At this stage, your customer is trying to make best use of what you've created for them, to execute it successfully, to find new, interesting and innovative ways to use it and to work out what to do next. This phase is often referred to as 'customer success', and period of a special relationship with your customer that may see many opportunities for new business with them.

That means that there's three stages of the customer journey that are particularly client-facing and interact here.

- **Pre-Sales**{.text-color-brand-secondary}
    — before the thing, in the run up to signing contracts
- **Delivery**{.text-color-brand-secondary}
    — doing the thing, executing on what you've agreed you'll do together
- **Success**{.text-color-brand-secondary}
    — after the thing, making the most of what you've done

The relationship between these three are intricate and sometimes clear lines of delineation aren't obvious. There's at least two positions you might take here, and which one you chose or prefer may depend on your company culture, your organisational structure, or even your market or sector.

### 1. Sales for when you're selling

The first and the third of these have a strong connection with the sales process. With the first, you're taking people on the journey to signing a contract. With the third, you're looking for continued business or opportunities for new business. That gives both a very strong sales flavour, so it may be worth viewing them both in that mode and under that department.

The advantage of this approach lies in playing to the strengths of each department, so the client gets specialists helping them at each stage of their journey.

**… OR …**

### 2. It's all part of the customer journey

For some customers, and some businesses too, having a strong delineation between sales and delivery is problematic and it can feel like the customer is being 'thrown over the fence' from one department to another once they sign the contract. It can be a strong differentiator to see the customer journey as one unified whole, from beginning to end. In practice, what that would mean is that the customer would be working with essentially the same team the whole way through, from pitch to live service (though you will probably need to augment the team during the delivery phase with particular specialists or sheer numbers to get the work done, of course).

It can save you headaches: in transferring knowledge, and in maintaining a coherent tone of voice throughout the customer journey.

&nbsp;

Whichever tack you prefer to take, the objective for your CDO will be different. With the first, your CDO is a collaborator with others, working as one of a team to create a unified customer experience from beginning to end. It also defines the relationship between your business and your customers — that they are something the business does something *for*. With the second, your CDO is responsible for the whole customer journey, with a strategy that has a whole arc from beginning to end.

Before we finish here, let's take a quick look a terminology.

Throughout the *Handbook* we refer to a 'Chief Delivery Officer' rather than other similar labels such as Client Services Director, a Professional Services lead (more appropriate in product or software-as-a-service [SaaS] businesses), or the head of a Project Management Office (PMO). Whilst some of those titles might make specific sense in certain contexts they don't necessarily in others (a 'director', for instance, commonly implies a board-level role, but it's increasingly used for roles of slightly-more-senior managers of things).

There's also roles and responsibilities that are closely connected, such as 'customer success' — many of these are dimensions of sales processes, but the customer's experience of the company should be differentiated by the stage they're at. Moreover, all of it is part of what they're being delivered — the thinking about what they want and need (the sales stage), actually doing the thing for them (the delivery stage), and getting the most out of it or even planning what next (the success stage).
