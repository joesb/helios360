  Before you hire a Client Services Director or Chief Delivery Officer or take on the role in a business yourself, there's some key questions that you need to ask yourself about the position and why it's important to you.

  The answers to these questions will give the CDO the best chance for positive impact on the business, your team, and your clients.

Before you become or you hire a Chief Delivery Officer, you need to consider the following questions and know how the business is going to answer them.

1. What do you want your Chief Delivery Officer to achieve?
2. Where will they go in the organisation?
3. At what level of seniority will they sit?
4. What and how are you going to invest in customer delivery?

You need to have worked through the first question before you can make progress with to the other three, and hopefully this *Handbook* will help you to wrestle with the issues this question poses. The answers to the subsequent three questions will determine the reach and scope that the CDO will have. Even the best CDO around will be able to have little impact if they are stuck in the day-to-day of specific customer project work and never get the chance to stand on higher ground, to take the time to survey the horizon and build plans.

Here, then, are some initial pointers for ways you can think about these things so that the CDO and the organisation are both set up for success.

First, let's take a look a terminology.

Throughout the *Handbook* we refer to a 'Chief Delivery Officer' rather than other similar labels such as Client Services Director, a Professional Services lead (more appropriate in product or software-as-a-service [SaaS] businesses), or the head of a Project Management Office (PMO). Whilst some of those titles might make specific sense in certain contexts they don't necessarily in others (a 'director', for instance, commonly implies a board-level role, but it's increasingly used for roles of slightly-more-senior managers of things).

There's also roles and responsibilities that are closely connected, such as 'customer success' — many of these are dimensions of sales processes, but the customer's experience of the company should be differentiated by the stage they're at. Moreover, all of it is part of what they're being delivered — the thinking about what they want and need (the sales stage), actually doing the thing for them (the delivery stage), and getting the most out of it or even planning what next (the success stage).
