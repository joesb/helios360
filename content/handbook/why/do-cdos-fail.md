*G*{.drop-first}iven that it's such a good idea to hire a Chief Delivery Officer, then, what can go wrong? What might make a CDO fail? And are there ways that you can prevent that happening in your organisation? Investing time, money and effort in a CDO is a significant thing with plenty of risks associated, as we've said, but if you know in advance what could go wrong you stand a better chance of things going right.

There's plenty of reasons why a Chief Delivery Officer could fail and this isn't an exhaustive list by any means, but avoiding these pitfalls will help you find a good path towards success.

## 1. Exoneration{.h4-style}

Hiring a CDO is more than a tick in a box. It doesn't absolve the rest of the business from responsibilities for what the company does for its customers, and it doesn't simply make client delivery the CDO's problem. It's better, instead, to think of the role of Chief Delivery Officer as a point of focus for what you do for your customers. The customer journey with the business is closest when you're delivering your services and products to them, but it doesn't begin and end there. The organisation needs a customer focus throughout the business.
