  Whether you're a services business or a product company, you need to deliver work for your clients. Often it's the part of the business that your clients experience most closely and, done well, is a foundation stone for your reputation.
  
  Consequently, delivery touches every part of your organisation. A CDO brings the integration between vision, strategy, and execution that you need to excel.

:H:{.drop-first}iring a CDO at the right level will be a big investment for the business. The person themselves will have costs, and they will likely also bring a team with them, maybe a mixture of internal and external people. There will be disruption to business-as-usual and a reduction in velocity whilst change is happening that itself will incur costs.

*So why do it?*

The business has been getting along fine so far. Why create the headache?

It's likely that some of the capabilities and skills for delivery already exist within the team, with scrum masters and delivery managers overseeing projects, and technical architects or senior designers who lead aspects of work and can deputise for delivering projects if needs be. Larger organisations may even have people in fairly senior roles, as a delivery lead or principal with responsibility for multiple projects simultaneously.

However, there may also be some core capabilities that are missing from the delivery office, or are subsumed under departments or aspects of the business and not properly devolved to the delivery office. A CDO who is given the task of bringing coherence, consistency, and high performance in delivering successfully for clients may also with to recruit for specific skills.

It's worth reflecting here, though — *did the business actually get along just fine before the Chief Delivery Officer?*

There's at least two answers to that question.

Firstly, of course they did — they wouldn’t be in business otherwise.

However, secondly, it quite likely that the business hasn't actually been doing that well, struggling in one or more aspects of delivering for clients, without acknowledging it or really understanding why. Sometimes, it's obvious that something's not working — stressed staff, unhappy clients, missed deadlines, etc. Sometimes, it's only through interpreting secondary symptoms that you realise there's a problem — the business feels like it's hit a ceiling of growth that it just can't push through, say. Sometimes, it's just a sense that the founder(s) or CEO has that things could be better.

## Delivery, Governance, Strategy

Projects need people to manage them. Work for clients needs people to be responsible for making sure it gets delivered, making sure the right people are doing the right things at the right time in the right way, with the resources and tools they need to get it done, with problems identified and risks raised and all handled appropriately to keep things on track and to get things to the destination as planned.

Project managers, delivery managers, team leads — all very straightforward and obvious roles, and it makes sense to hire as many project and/or delivery managers as you need, trained and empowered, to keep the show on the road.

As a first impression, this is a fairly compelling way to address issues with delivering services for clients. The more clients and the more projects you have, the more people you hire to cover all the things. It's a fairly simple logic.
