  Whether you're a services business or a product company, you need to deliver work for your clients. Often it's the part of the business that your clients experience most closely and, done well, is a foundation stone for your reputation.
  
  Consequently, delivery touches every part of your organisation. A CDO brings the integration between vision, strategy, and execution that you need to excel.

If a CDO is hired at the right level, it will be a big investment for the business. The person themselves will have costs, but they will likely also bring a team with them, maybe a mixture of internal and external people. Additionally, there will be disruption to business-as-usual and a reduction in velocity whilst change is happening that itself will incur costs.

So why do it? The business has been getting along fine so far. Why create the headache?

It's likely that some of the capabilities and skills for delivery already exist within the team, with scrum masters and delivery managers overseeing projects, and technical architects or senior designers who lead aspects of work and can deputise for delivering projects if needs be. Larger organisations may even have people in fairly senior roles, as a delivery lead or principal with responsibility for multiple projects simultaneously. However, there may also be some core capabilities that are missing from the delivery office, or are subsumed under departments or aspects of the business and not properly devolved to the delivery office. A CDO who is given the task of bringing coherence, consistency, and high performance in delivering successfully for clients may also with to recruit for specific skills.

It's worth reflecting here, though — did the business actually get along just fine before the Chief Delivery Officer? There's at least two answers to that question.

Firstly, of course they did — they wouldn’t be in business otherwise.

However, secondly, it's likely that they haven't been doing so well, struggling in one or more aspects of delivering for clients without really understanding why. Sometimes, it's obvious that something's not working too well — stressed staff, unhappy clients, etc. Sometimes, there's symptoms that can be read that indicate there's a problem — the business feels like it's hit a ceiling of growth that it just can't push through, say. Sometimes, it's just a sense that the founder(s) or CEO has that things could be better.
