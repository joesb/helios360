In this section, we look at the need for a chief of delivery from all perspectives — the CDO themselves, the delivery team within the organisation, the c-suite or executive team colleagues in the business, the founder(s)/owner(s) of the company, the clients and customers of the business, the personnel team and recruiters, and more.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

That means that the 'you' in the question above is definitely you, whichever role you have or perspective from which you're looking.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

In the question above there's a presumption of success — that the Chief Delivery Officer will bring rigour and performance to your client delivery processes and practices, seeing improvements in project or service delivery and triumphs across the board. But not all CDOs are successful, or aren't able to be, so we'll also look at the reasons why client delivery leadership can falter and what could be going on in those situations.

This section will also cover how you can get the best our of your CDO — what do you actually do when you have a delivery principal on board?

And finally we'll take a view of things through the lens of metrics — how to understand the impact that your CDO is making to the business.

With all those questions covered that should put us in a strong position to understanding why your organisation needs a Chief Delivery Officer. Excellent.{.margin-block-vlg .padding-block-start-vlg}
