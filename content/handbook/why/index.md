  Why does a business need a Chief Delivery Officer (CDO) or some sort of delivery principal? They'll add costs and disrupt the organisation, and the business got along fine without one, right?
  
  So why might you need one?

In this section, we look at the need for a chief of delivery from all perspectives — the CDO themselves, the delivery team within the organisation, the C-suite or executive team colleagues in the business, the founder(s)/owner(s) of the company, the clients and customers of the business, the personnel team and recruiters, and more.

That means that the 'you' in the question above is definitely you, whichever role you have or perspective from which you're looking.

In the question above there's a presumption of success — that the Chief Delivery Officer will bring rigour and performance to your client delivery processes and practices, seeing improvements in project or service delivery and triumphs across the board. But not all CDOs are successful, or aren't able to be, so we'll also look at the reasons why client delivery leadership can falter and what could be going on in those situations.

This section will also cover how you can get the best our of your CDO — what do you actually do when you have a delivery principal on board?

And finally we'll take a view of things through the lens of metrics — how to understand the impact that your CDO is making to the business.

With all those questions covered that should put us in a strong position to understanding why your organisation needs a Chief Delivery Officer.

[Karim Marucchi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karimmarucchi/){target=_blank rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"}, CEO of Wordpress agency Crowd Favorite, believes that the role of the CDO is the essential way a professional services business can distinguish itself and grow into maturity.

In this chapter we're going to find out exactly why. Excellent.
