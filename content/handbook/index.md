A combination of a playbook and a reference tool, *The Chief Delivery Officer's Handbook* is designed to accelerate your route to learning, with insights into the role of Chief Delivery Officer (CDO), a Client Services Director (CSD) or Project Management Office lead (PMO), their place in the business and their role with customers.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}
