A combination of a playbook and a reference tool, *The Handbook* is designed to accelerate your route to learning, with insights into the role of Chief Delivery Officer (CDO), a Client Services Director (CSD) or Project Management Office lead (PMO), their place in the business and their role with customers.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

Most importantly, it puts the role into the context of a C-suite player for organisations that understand that their success depends on high performance client projects.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

The *Handbook* covers everything you need to know, written in an accessible and practical manner for those who wish to understand their role better, for those wanting to step up into this role, or for founder-owners who are considering what this role may add to their executive team.

## What is a Chief Delivery Officer?

The most important question first:

*What even is a CDO?*{.padding-inline-start-lg .large}

Here is a working definition:

The Chief Delivery Officer is a key leadership role.{.padding-inline-start-lg .margin-block-start-vlg .padding-block-start-vlg .border-block-start-md}

Normally an executive-level role, the CDO works closely with other leaders in the organisation — the CEO, Chief Technology Officer, Creative Director, Chief Operating Officer, Commercial Director, and so on — to align the client delivery strategy with both the business goals and customers' needs.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

A CDO is responsible for the success of client projects through the entire customer lifecycle, from delivery discovery, planning and design through execution and onwards into live service and evaluation. This usually means delivering a service for customers, commonly in creative and digital agencies or for product or SaaS companies, but could just as well apply in large infrastructure or transformation projects and programs as well.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

More than overseeing the day-to-day, week-to-week client project work, though, the CDO is the focus point for a customer's experience of the business. Service delivery is often the part of the business that clients experience most closely and, done well, is a foundation stone for an organisation's reputation.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

Consequently, the CDO takes the responsibility for a large part of the customer journey.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

They design and execute a client service strategy that aligns with the company's business goals, operating capabilities, sector and specialisms, and their clients' needs. They lead and support the company's professional services teams — the delivery managers, designers, engineers, consultants, analysts, and so on — making sure they have the training, resources, tools, processes and guidance that results in coherence across the business and enables consistently high-quality outcomes for customers.{.padding-inline-start-lg .margin-block-end-vlg .padding-block-end-vlg .border-block-end-md}

We'll come back to this definition in due course, in many other sections of this *Handbook*. For now, though, this is a good place to start.
