## What is a Chief Delivery Officer?

The most important question first:

*What even is a Chief Delivery Officer?*{.padding-inline-start-lg .large}

Here is a working definition:

The Chief Delivery Officer (CDO) is a key leadership role.{.padding-inline-start-lg .margin-block-start-vlg .padding-block-start-vlg .border-block-start-md}

Normally an executive-level role, the CDO works closely with other leaders in the organisation — the CEO, Chief Technology Officer, Creative Director, Chief Operating Officer, Commercial Director, and so on — to align the client delivery strategy with both the business goals and customers' needs.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

A CDO is responsible for the successful delivery of projects through the entire delivery lifecycle, from strategy, planning and design through execution and onwards into live service and evaluation. This usually means the delivery of a service for customers, commonly in creative and digital agencies or for product or SaaS companies, but could just as well apply in large infrastructure or transformation projects and programs as well.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

More than overseeing delivery, though, the Chief Delivery Officer is the focus point for a customer's experience of the business. Service delivery is often the part of the business that clients experience most closely and, done well, is a foundation stone for an organisation's reputation.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

Consequently, the CDO takes the responsibility for a large part of the customer journey. They design and execute a delivery strategy that aligns with the company's business goals, operating capabilities, sector and specialisms, and their clients' needs. They lead and support the company's delivery teams — the delivery managers, designers, engineers, consultants, analysts, and so on — making sure they have the training, resources, tools, processes and guidance that results in coherence across the business and enables consistently high-quality outcomes for customers.{.padding-inline-start-lg .margin-block-end-vlg .padding-block-end-vlg .border-block-end-md}

We'll come back to this definition in due course, in many other sections of this *Handbook*. For now, though, this is a good place to start.
