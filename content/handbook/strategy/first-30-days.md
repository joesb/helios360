It's best to approach this from two directions. First, what are the questions that should be on your mind in those first 30 days? And second, what practical things do you want to achieve before the first month is out?

In other words, what are you trying to understand initially? And how can you actually do that?

Let's dive in.

## The Questions on the CDO's Mind

Although there'll be lots of questions you'll want to ask at the beginning, there's some specific things that should shape how you start trying to gauge the state of play.

### What’s going on?

Starting in a new role as Chief Delivery Officer, you're walking into an organisation that’s accustomed to a certain way of working. We've just looked at the [challenges of interpreting and evaluating business-as-usual](/handbook/strategy/bau-world/), so there's no need to reiterate here. At this point, rather than getting your hands around ongoing customer projects, the day-to-day of product development, or other aspects of BAU, instead you're mind is on how the delivery unit and individual teams are operating.

#### Taking the temperature

Although the interview process before you start should've laid out the most important issues to address there's only so much you can find out in that context, and there's a strong chance that some aspects may've been actively hidden from you behind a veneer of sorts.

In this first 30 days, fully understanding what you're letting yourself in for is fundamental.

To do that, you need to use your thermometer to take the temperature of the organisation. You're trying to find out not so much what the business does but how it does it.

And that starts with listening. Lots of listening. Going out of your way to listen. And then listening some more.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

Take as much time as you can to meet with people. Invite people for morning coffee, or lunch, or afternoon tea, or a walk around the block. Travel to where they are, if they're in a different office and you can — making an effort and meeting in person is powerful. Meet on a video call. Whatever. Just meet with people.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

Ask open questions, about the challenges they're facing, the opportunities they see or needs they have, give people lots of space to talk about their priorities.{.content-canvas-item-main-left-main-end}

- What are they concerned about?
- What keeps them awake at night?
- What are they really proud of?
- What chances do they think the business is missing?
- Where do they see friction in the way things are done?

You'll be amazed to hear how some delivery difficulties are actually interconnected company-wide issues.

##### Who should you meet with?

In the main, it probably means department heads or leaders of teams or units within the business, but don't overlook talking to regular team members as well. You should be trying to look at things from as many different angles as you can to get a full and complete picture.

Everyone is busy, but directors and execs are notoriously hard to get time with. That said, they'll probably have a shopping list of things they need help with, probably a bunch of things that you can offer to get involved with for them, and that may be your way in.

And make sure you go beyond your part of the business, too — colleagues in product, sales and marketing, customer support and client success, legal, finance, operations, and so on, all have important perspectives on things that you'll be feeling from the customer delivery end of things.

##### What to listen for

As you talk with folks inevitably they'll tell you about problems, and you should be particularly attentive to the things that are being brought to the surface. Some will be obvious, others less so and may only be apparent when you've had some time to reflect.

You can use these questions as a personal prompt as you let all these things marinate in your mind:

- What are the problems, as you see them?
  - Where are these issues in the business or delivery cycle?
  - Do you need to ask some follow-up questions to verify or clarify things?
- Are they aware that they have problems?
- Are they aware those problems need tackling?
- Do they understand the problems they have?

Be particularly aware of responses like:

- 'oh, that's the way we do things around here,' or
- 'well, that's how Serena prefers things to be done,' or worse
- 'ah, we've tried that before and it just doesn't work for us'.

### Who's making delivery decisions?

How are decisions being made?
How do they get made that way?
What’s driving them?
And why?

### How did we get here?
