It's best to approach this from two directions. First, what are the questions that should be on your mind in those first 30 days? And second, what practical things do you want to achieve before the first month is out?

In other words, what are you trying to understand initially? And how can you actually do that?

Let's dive in.

## The Questions on the CDO's Mind

Although there'll be lots of questions you'll want to ask at the beginning, there's some specific things that should shape how you start trying to gauge the state of play.

### What’s going on?

Starting in a new role as Chief Delivery Officer, you're walking into an organisation that’s accustomed to a certain way of working. We've just looked at the [challenges of interpreting and evaluating business-as-usual](/handbook/strategy/bau-world/), so there's no need to reiterate here. At this point, rather than getting your hands around ongoing customer projects, the day-to-day of product development, or other aspects of BAU, instead you're mind is on how the delivery unit and individual teams are operating.

#### Taking the temperature

  - Are they aware that they have problems?
    - Where/what are they?
  - Are they aware those problems need tackling?
  - Do they understand the problems they have?
- What is the veneer?!?

### Who's making delivery decisions?

How are decisions being made?
How do they get made that way?
What’s driving them?
And why?

### How did we get here?
