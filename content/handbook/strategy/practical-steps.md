  So you're in your new role. What do you actually do in the first month?

  You know what you need to be thinking about. But what actions should you take?

  Here's some pragmatic and functional things you can put into play, stuff that will help you understand the task ahead and how you can take it on.

So, your first month, real world. What do you actually do?

Here's a set of hands-on suggestions for specific activities to cover that should point you in the right direction.

## Needs and objectives{.content-canvas-item-wide-left-more}

In these first 30 days you need to understand the objectives that will drive you from two directions:

1. *the goals of the business*{.larger}
  as it moves forward in its mission
2. *the needs of the delivery team*{.larger}
  as they fulfil client projects

Consequently, your activities should look in both these directions.

### The business objectives

There's several things you can do here:

#### 1. Dialogue with the CEO

Naturally, you will be meeting with the CEO at the beginning of your time, and again at the end of the first month to summarise your analysis and insights (and maybe once or twice in between, too).

The agenda of your first meeting, or a follow-up if necessary, should include an in-depth discussion about the mission and goals of the business, and how it's seeking to achieve those. That should cover:

1. **The vision and mission**
    - Not just the trite or top-line view
    - The motives that drive the vision
    - The aims of the mission
2. **The strategy for achieving those aims**
    - What is the current quarterly/half-year objective?
      - How is it being implemented?
      - How is it being measured?
    - And what is the next objective?
    - The business should have a goal-setting or objective framework of some kind in place
      - E.g. OKRs, Big Rocks, VMOS(T/A), or some other form of KPIs
    - What is the 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, plan?
3. **How role does client delivery play in fulfilling these?**
    - How does the CEO perceive the place of customer and project outcomes in the life and future of the business?

  {% endMarkdown %}
  </blockquote>
{% endColourBG %}

Follow your discussion with the CEO with any reading you can — documents and documentation on the objectives (current and past) and their outcomes, including slide decks, board reports, memos, and more. It's important to understand how this stuff is summarised, and how it's communicated to the wider organisation.

#### 2. Discussion with the exec and heads of departments

It may not be appropriate in your first meeting with the new exec team, but it's important to understand the same questions at this level. So add an agenda point for one of your first few meetings to cover this as part of 'bringing you up-to-speed'.

However, your focus when you're asking these questions goes beyond just re-hashing the same material and adding colour. *What you're really listening for* when asking these questions at this level is:

- How do the exec team members (CTO, COO, CMO, CISO, etc.) and their business units own these things?
  - the vision, the mission, the strategy, especially the quarterly/half-yearly goals and longer-term plan
- How do the exec team and their business units interpret these things and turn them into action?
  - how do the objectives cascade down into actionable goals in each part of the organisation?
  - what are they putting into practice to achieve those objectives/outcomes?
  - are they measuring things?
    - and if so, what?

  {% endMarkdown %}
  </blockquote>
{% endColourBG %}

You should probably consider doing the same with heads of departments and others significant people who aren't part of the exec team.

### The delivery unit's needs

As well as the objectives of the business, you need to understand how the customer/project delivery unit works as a whole, how individual teams work within it, what needs they have and what challenges they face.

Some of this will come from observation and one-to-one discussions, but some may need a more structured approach.

#### 3. Workshops with the delivery team

Whilst ad hoc or impromptu conversations with delivery personnel are important, as we said previously, you may also consider running a workshop or two to help you understand how things work in this new organisation.

Here's a couple of suggestions. You may have other thoughts yourself.

##### 3.1. Hold a project post-mortem{.margin-block-end-lg}

Take a recent client project and conduct a retrospective or post-mortem together. Doesn't need to be one that's been problematic or failed — in fact, assessing a successful one is probably more politically astute.

You should run this using a Retrospective meeting format (i.e. what went well?; what didn't go well?; what could be improved or tried?; what did we learn?).

You probably ought to send a questionnaire in advance, for those who like some unpressured thinking time, with variations on these questions (e.g. use the 4 Ls — 2/3 things you liked, lacked, longed for, learned).

You should definitely capture the outcomes and send a summary or recap to everyone.

##### 3.2 Write the CEOs speech{.margin-block-end-lg}

Take ideas for a new product or service for the business based on recent learning or a specific project outcome. Choose one.

Imagine that it's going to be launched in 12/18 months following an extended effort by the delivery team. The CEO will give a speech at an industry conference to announce it.

Split into 2/3 teams and write the CEOs speech. Each team presents it to the wider group.

##### Paying attention{.margin-block-end-lg}

As well as the specific outcomes, you're really listening for the undercurrents in these workshops.

- How do these people work together?
- How do they feel about the work they do?
- How do they feel about the business as a whole and their contribution to it's goals?
- What are their gripes and frustrations?
- Are there obvious challenges or difficulties?

The things you detect will start to form the basis of the strategy you'll need to be putting in place.
