  So you're in your new role. What do you actually do in the first month?

  You know what you need to be thinking about. But what actions should you take?

  Here's some pragmatic and functional things you can put into play, stuff that will help you understand the task ahead and how you can take it on.

So, your first month, real world. What do you actually do?

Here's a set of hands-on suggestions for specific activities to cover that should point you in the right direction.

## Needs and objectives{.content-canvas-item-wide-left-more}

In these first 30 days you need to understand the objectives that will drive you from two directions:

1. *the goals of the business*{.larger}
  as it moves forward in its mission
2. *the needs of the delivery team*{.larger}
  as they fulfil client projects

Consequently, your activities should look in both these directions.

### The business objectives

There's several things you can do here:

#### 1. Dialogue with the CEO

Naturally, you will be meeting with the CEO at the beginning of your time, and again at the end of the first month to summarise your analysis and insights (and maybe once or twice in between, too).

The agenda of your first meeting, or a follow-up if necessary, should include an in-depth discussion about the mission and goals of the business, and how it's seeking to achieve those. That should cover:

1. **The vision and mission**
    - Not just the trite or top-line view
    - The motives that drive the vision
    - The aims of the mission
2. **The strategy for achieving those aims**
    - What is the current quarterly/half-year objective?
      - How is it being implemented?
      - How is it being measured?
    - And what is the next objective?
    - The business should have a goal-setting or objective framework of some kind in place
      - E.g. OKRs, Big Rocks, VMOS(T/A), or some other form of KPIs
    - What is the 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, plan?
3. **How role does client delivery play in fulfilling these?**
    - How does the CEO perceive the place of customer and project outcomes in the life and future of the business?

{.padding-block-lg .content-canvas-item-wide-left-more}
  {% endMarkdown %}
{% endColourBG %}

Follow your discussion with the CEO with any reading you can — documents and documentation on the objectives (current and past) and their outcomes, including slide decks, board reports, memos, and more. It's important to understand how this stuff is summarised, and how it's communicated to the wider organisation.

#### 2. Discussion with the exec and heads of departments

It may not be appropriate in your first meeting with the new exec team, but it's important to understand the same questions at this level. So add an agenda point for one of your first few meetings to cover this as part of 'bringing you up-to-speed'.

However, your focus when you're asking these questions goes beyond just re-hashing the same material and adding colour. *What you're really listening for* when asking these questions at this level is:

- How do the exec team members (CTO, COO, CMO, CISO, etc.) and their business units own these things?
  - the vision, the mission, the strategy, especially the quarterly/half-yearly goals and longer-term plan
- How do the exec team and their business units interpret these things and turn them into action?
  - how do the objectives cascade down into actionable goals in each part of the organisation?
  - what are they putting into practice to achieve those objectives/outcomes?
  - are they measuring things?
    - and if so, what?

{% ColourBG 'secondary' %}
  {% Markdown %}
> How do the objectives cascade down into actionable goals in each part of the organisation?{.vlarge .bold .headings-font .lineheight-1}
{.padding-block-lg .content-canvas-item-wide-left-more}
  {% endMarkdown %}
{% endColourBG %}

You should probably consider doing the same with heads of departments and others significant people who aren't part of the exec team.

### The delivery unit's needs

As well as the objectives of the business, you need to understand how the customer/project delivery unit works as a whole, how individual teams work within it, what needs they have and what challenges they face.

Some of this will come from observation and one-to-one discussions, but some may need a more structured approach.

#### 3. Workshops with the delivery team

Whilst ad hoc or impromptu conversations with delivery personnel are important, as we said previously, you may also consider running a workshop or two to help you understand how things work in this new organisation.

Here's a couple of suggestions. You may have other thoughts yourself.

##### 3.1. Hold a project post-mortem{.margin-block-end-lg}

Take a recent client project and conduct a retrospective or post-mortem together. Doesn't need to be one that's been problematic or failed — in fact, assessing a successful one is probably more politically astute.

You should run this using a Retrospective meeting format (i.e. what went well?; what didn't go well?; what could be improved or tried?; what did we learn?).

You probably ought to send a questionnaire in advance, for those who like some unpressured thinking time, with variations on these questions (e.g. use the 4 Ls — 2/3 things you liked, lacked, longed for, learned).

You should definitely capture the outcomes and send a summary or recap to everyone.

##### 3.2 Write the CEOs speech{.margin-block-end-lg}

Take ideas for a new product or service for the business based on recent learning or a specific project outcome. Choose one.

Imagine that it's going to be launched in 12/18 months following an extended effort by the delivery team. The CEO will give a speech at an industry conference to announce it.

Split into 2/3 teams and write the CEOs speech. Each team presents it to the wider group.

##### Paying attention{.margin-block-end-lg}

As well as the specific outcomes, you're really listening for the undercurrents in these workshops.

- How do these people work together?
- How do they feel about the work they do?
- How do they feel about the business as a whole and their contribution to it's goals?
- What are their gripes and frustrations?
- Are there obvious challenges or difficulties?

The things you detect will start to form the basis of the strategy you'll need to be putting in place.

## Stakeholder mapping

A really useful exercise to understand the organisation and who's concerned with what you is to create a stakeholder map. You may be familiar with this sort of thing already, so if so here's a refresher.

### Factors to consider

What you're trying to examine with this sort of task is how the organisation will respond to what you do in your work.

1. **Who has the most influence on your freedom of movement?**
    - Or, whose say-so will determine what you can and can't do?
2. **Which people will be most affected by changes you make?**
    - Or, if and when you change things, whose day-to-day will change (for better or worse)?
3. **Who controls the resources?**
    - That's *all* the resources — finances, people, technology, time, and so on.
4. **How should you handle important people who actually won’t be considered stakeholders?**
    - Some people will think of themselves as stakeholders but, in fact, only need to be informed of changes.

There's many ways that you can do that but the outcome might look something like this chart below.

{% ImgFigure 'An example stakeholder map.', image.side_classes_2 %}![A stakeholder map chart](/public/images/handbook/Helios360-StakeholderMap.png){.image-rounded eleventy:widths="200,350,575,760,1200"}{% endImgFigure %}

This is only example data, of course, all completely made up, and likely missing a good number of job roles out, too. That said, this is an illustration of how the exercise can help build your conception of the organisation, and how it can shape how to approach your role and impact.

If you're trying to work out how to score individuals in the organisation, remember that you're trying to determine the top motivations and interests of your stakeholders. When deciding the driving force of stakeholders, consider:​

- Who has a financial stake/interest.
- Who has an emotional interest (don’t underestimate this; if this project was someone’s “baby,” keeping them happy and in the loop is critical).
- What are the top motivations for each stakeholder?
- Who are the biggest supporters?
- ​Who are the biggest non-supporters or naysayers?

{.padding-block-lg .content-canvas-item-wide-left-more}

  {% endMarkdown %}
{% endColourBG %}

### The map you produce

The idea with this chart is to end up with 4 quadrants.

{% ImgFigure 'The quadrants of a stakeholder map.', image.side_classes_2 %}![A stakeholder map chart divided in quarters](/public/images/handbook/Helios360-StakeholderMap-Quarters.png){.image-rounded eleventy:widths="200,350,575,760,1200"}{% endImgFigure %}

1. **Work with**
    - or *Involve* in shorthand
    - Those you'll work with most directly in developing and executing your strategy. These are also people with skin in the game, who will influence what you do and be affected by the choices you make.
2. **Consult with**
    - or *Consult*
    - Those whose views are important and probably have a fair bit of authority, but won't be so affected by directly by changes you make, and certainly not in their daily work.
3. **Keep satisfied**
    - or *Approval*
    - People who will be affected and probably need to adapt how they work — so don't frustrate them! — but they'll be responsive rather than active agents in your changes.
    - Or, people who may have some governance or other control over how you execute your work, such as HR, legal or finance, say.
4. **Keep informed**
    - or *Inform*
    - These are probably not actual stakeholders, but will nonetheless take a keen interest in what you do.
    - Some may be marginal cases, but it's good to be hard-nosed in assigning people to this grouping — over-consulting will kill your progress.

**Note:** there are other approaches to charting things that could work, such as the Three I-s method — influence; interest; impact. Do whatever's most appropriate for your context.{.smaller .italic}

Data for the above came from a simple spreadsheet looking like this.

{% ImgFigure 'Stakeholder map source spreadsheet.', image.side_classes_2 %}![A stakeholder map chart divided in quarters](/public/images/handbook/Helios360-StakeholderMap-spreadsheet.png){.image-rounded .image-border .padding-sml eleventy:widths="200,350,575,760,1200"}{% endImgFigure %}

You can check out [the stakeholder map spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wYiPak-4_1yDZJLIv1mCOsB4luJXRFC3isfeZLQ1TQc/edit?gid=1011499677#gid=1011499677){target=_blank rel="nofollow noreferrer"} for yourself.{.smaller}

### When you have your map

It's important to be as empirical as possible, so make sure you validate what you've produced.

- Check it over with key people and review each person's position on the chart.
- Change as needed, making a record of the reasoning if that's helpful.

Once you have your map finalised, this is the basis of an engagement plan — both now, in this first 30 days, and ongoing as you and your strategy get more embedded. So, review it regularly, and update it throughout your tenure.

## Assess the risks

{% ImgFigure 'A clear view of what’s ahead. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/white-and-red-kanji-text-kjqTlMHLci4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photo</a> by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dallimonti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrés Dallimonti</a> on Unsplash.', image.side_classes_2 %}![Two pilots sitting a plane cockpit](/public/images/source/andres-dallimonti-kjqTlMHLci4-unsplash.jpg){.image-rounded-lg .image-border eleventy:widths="200,350,575,760,1980"}{% endImgFigure %}

We'll talk in [more detail elsewhere](/handbook/delivery/) *(page forthcoming)*{.small} about better approaches to managing risks. However you go about it, the point here is that risk assessment is a helpful practice for getting yourself oriented when you first start in your new role as a director of project or service delivery.

The point of an assessment of risks at this stage is layered:

- to understand the forces, internal and external, that you're may confront
- the likelihood of them having affecting the delivery unit in the business
- the scale of the impact they might have
- whether they can be mitigated
  - and if so, how
- and how that will your ability to design and successfully execute your strategy

The outcome of your assessment will shape the plans that you put in place.

{% endColourBG %}

### Altitudes of thinking

 What's worth stressing here is that that you should be approaching this by thinking of risks at different altitudes.

1. Global
2. National
3. Organisation
4. Service
5. Team
{reversed}

By separating out the altitudes of risk in this manner you can adjust the way you think about them. Risks at different altitudes impact in different ways, and therefore demand that we respond differently.

#### Global and National{.border-block-end .heading-full}

Political, social, societal and technological factors all operate at this level.

*👉*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md}Most are fairly slow-moving, appear with plenty of warning (election cycles, say) and any risk posed can be easier to mitigate as a result (though some are very uncertain, such as the political and economic impacts of Brexit, the US tariff regime, etc.).{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*👉*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md}Others may seem unlikely but can appear quickly with devastating effects. As we've seen in recent years with the Covid-19 pandemic, there are risks that operate at a global level that have clear and direct impacts at personal level.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

*👉*{.drop-first .drop-first-vsm .margin-inline-end-md}Some (war, say) are exceedingly rare, in the main, and probably don't need to feature on your register.{.padding-inline-start-lg}

The risks are real, though our response is less about removing the risk and rather the actions we might need to take.

{% Note true, 'content-note-info' %}
**On the risk of pandemic**, note also that global disease is no less likely now than it was in 2020, and global attitudes to healthcare responses, vaccines in particular, are shifting under continuing pressure from adherents to conspiracy theories.{.italic}
{% endNote %}

It's worth remembering also that there's some risks operating at the Global and National level that don't separate neatly between the two — societal and market fluctuations or full-on shocks are often both, for instance.

#### Organisational{.border-block-end .heading-full}

At this level we're considering the risks that face the organisation. In general, you should be considering things in these areas:

- **strategic risks** — what will impact how the business can achieve its goals, and long-term health?
  - e.g. shifts in technology or market; competition; strategic capabilities; etc.
- **operational risks** — what issues with processes, people, or systems may impede operations?
  - e.g. scalability of key IT/software; key talent retention; data vulnerabilities; unscaling workflows; supply chain dependencies; etc.
- **financial risks** — what will affect the financial stability and longevity of the business?
  - e.g. runway; access to funding; loan liabilities; market or economic volatility, including inflationary pressures; taxation changes; etc.
- **compliance risks** — meeting regulatory, legal, or industry standards
  - e.g. changes in regulatory climate, such as with Brexit; data management regulation; changes to tax or employment law; etc.

Many of these dimensions may feature in business-as-usual, the things the organisation naturally faces and remediates in the course of business.

But it's vital to take a good, hard look at organisational risks — clear and specific issues must be identified wherever possible.

You do not want to get caught out by [Donald Rumsfeld's ‘unknown unknowns’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns) through a lack of thoroughness or due diligence.
