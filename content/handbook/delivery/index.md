jumbotron: |
  When it comes to delivering for clients, it's common to want to be seen doing things, being busy, making stuff happen. But that's the straight and easy road to Problemsville.

  So, instead: *think slow, act fast.*
  
  Or, the subtle art of getting stuff done.

This section is about the business end of delivery leadership. We look at important things to bear in mind when actually delivering work for customers, especially what the means for you as a project management leader.

These are the things that are the basis of your project delivery strategy: the particular methods, practices, processes, and tools that you'll need your teams to employ whenever they're delivering for clients. And they're the things that people in your teams will draw on in the tactical world of day-to-day where your strategy is executed.

We look at all the stages of the project lifecycle, from the very beginning to the very end, covering:

1. Proposal and commitment
2. Kick-off and inception
3. Discovery and research
4. Prototyping and planning
5. Building and developing
6. Live service and improvements
7. Retirement and decommissioning

In particular, we look at the principles that should guide the Chief Delivery Officer at every point in that lifecycle, the things that bring coherence in practices and consistency in outcomes, time after time.
