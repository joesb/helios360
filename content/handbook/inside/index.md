  Here we look at how the CDO relates to the rest of the business.
  
  In particular, we examine how the CDO is different from a Chief Customer Officer, and how that role relates to the product or service leaders in the organisation and those leading other delivery-centric disciplines, as well as to those responsible for other essential business functions.
  
  Most important, we shine a light on the vital relationship with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

  Lastly, here we look at the key topics of developing people and capabilities, and building and maintaining working relationships, in the context of the responsibility for consistent customer outcomes.
  
  This chapter, then, is aimed at the business stakeholders.

This chapter takes a long hard look at how a Chief Delivery Officer relates to colleagues in the business.

In the first place, that's about how the role finds a distinctive place at an increasingly crowded table in the C-suite.

For organisations that understand that their success depends on high performance work for clients, that's an easier position to take. For businesses with existing roles that may overlap — Chief Information Officer, Chief Customer Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and more — that may require elbows that are more pointed to advocate for this vital voice.
