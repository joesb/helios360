  Here we look at how the CDO relates to the rest of the business.
  
  In particular, we examine how the CDO is different from a Chief Customer Officer, and how the CDO relates to the product or service leaders in the organisation and those leading other delivery-centric disciplines.
  
  Most important, we shine a light on the relationship the CDO has with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

  Lastly, here we look at the key topics of developing people and capabilities, and building and maintaining working relationships, in the context of the responsibility for consistent customer outcomes.
  
  This chapter, then, is aimed at the business stakeholders.
